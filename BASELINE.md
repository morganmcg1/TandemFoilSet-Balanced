# Baseline — TandemFoilSet (icml-appendix-willow-pai2g-48h-r3)

This is round 1 of a fresh launch. No baseline metrics are recorded yet.

The reference baseline is the as-is `train.py` on this branch:

## Reference config

- Optimizer: AdamW(lr=5e-4, weight_decay=1e-4)
- LR schedule: CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=epochs)
- Batch size: 4
- Loss: vol_mse + surf_weight * surf_mse, surf_weight=10.0, normalized-space MSE
- Epochs: 50 (capped at `SENPAI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30` wall clock)
- Model: Transolver — n_hidden=128, n_layers=5, n_head=4, slice_num=64, mlp_ratio=2 (~1M params)

## Primary metric

`val_avg/mae_surf_p` — equal-weight mean surface pressure MAE across the four validation splits. Lower is better. The paper-facing number is `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (also lower is better), computed at the end of every run from the best-val checkpoint.

## Status

No prior runs on this branch yet. The first round of experiments establishes the reference numbers — every PR should report its full val_avg/mae_surf_p, test_avg/mae_surf_p, and the four per-split surface pressure MAE numbers.
