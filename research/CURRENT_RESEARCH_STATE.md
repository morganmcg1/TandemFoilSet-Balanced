## Research contract

Beat the Transolver baseline on `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (lower is better). Paper-facing metric: `test_avg/mae_surf_p`.

## Current best baselines

| Config | val_avg | test_avg | Source | Note |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|------|
| **h=128+SwiGLU (PROGRAMME BEST)** | **65.44** | **62.04** | PR #3680, W&B `8on2llcv`, seed=0 | Requires `--use_swiglu` + h=128/T_max=15 override |
| h=192+GELU (advisor default) | 86.81 | 81.35 | PR #3562 | Current train.py default |
| h=128+GELU μ̂ (canonical) | 90.77 ± 1.54 | 85.85 ± 0.67 | PR #3546 | Old 4-seed canonical |

**⚠️ Two unresolved questions before declaring a new canonical:**
1. **Seed reproducibility**: val=65.44 is single seed=0 — fern #3765 running seeds 1+2 to confirm
2. **h=192 stacking**: does SwiGLU compound with capacity? — thorfinn #3764

**Effective win threshold** (pending seed confirmation): val < 65.44 on the h=128+SwiGLU or h=192+SwiGLU config.

## SwiGLU discovery — key implications

The SwiGLU result (val 90.77→65.44, −27.9%) reframes the entire programme:

1. **The FFN nonlinearity was the dominant unexplored lever.** All prior work (loss shape, LR schedule, weight averaging, regularization) operated within the old GELU regime. The activation class was untouched.

2. **Selective gating is ideally matched to CFD pressure.** Pressure fields have sharp spatial gradients (boundary layers, wake regions). SwiGLU's gate learns to suppress "irrelevant" tokens (far-field, wake) and amplify "relevant" ones (surface boundary layer) per-step. GELU cannot do this.

3. **Param parity is exact.** The 2/3 hidden-dim factor (171 vs 256) preserves n_params=663K vs 663K. This is not a capacity gain — it's purely an architectural expressiveness gain.

4. **All prior h=128+GELU experiments are now sub-threshold.** PRs that showed gains vs GELU μ̂=90.77 (inverse-LLRD 88.03, h=192 89.70) are below the new floor. Future experiments compare to 65.44.

## Immediate next priorities

1. **#3765 fern seed confirmation** — CRITICAL. Must confirm val=65.44 is reproducible before any follow-on work.
2. **#3764 thorfinn h=192+SwiGLU** — determines the canonical production config.
3. **#3768 frieren inverse-LLRD+SwiGLU** — lever stacking test.
4. **#3735 askeladd h=192 variance** — less critical now (h=192+GELU may not be the best config), but still useful for calibration.

## Next research directions (post SwiGLU confirmation)

1. **Wider SwiGLU (h=192/256+SwiGLU)** — stacking gating with capacity, testing #3764.
2. **SwiGLU + dropout** — if alphonse #3678 shows dropout helps GELU, test dropout+SwiGLU.
3. **SwiGLU + per-channel surf weight β_p=20** — stacking edward's #3611 lever with the new activation.
4. ~~**SwiGLU + corrected h-flip**~~ — **DEAD** (z-flip family closed via #3724; ground effect breaks z-symmetry).
5. **SwiGLU + constant-tail SWA** — once nezuko #3644 finishes rebase, test SWA on SwiGLU.
6. **GeGLU activation** — tanjiro pending (PR TBD): isolates whether SwiGLU's +25pt comes from gating-in-general or SiLU-specifically. One-line swap of SiLU → GELU in the gate.
7. **ReGLU / Bilinear gate alternatives** — follow-up to GeGLU if gating-mechanism theory confirmed.
8. **Per-layer SwiGLU** — selective gating in only some blocks (e.g., only bottom 2 or 3 layers where geometry encoding is primary).
9. **T_max scan on SwiGLU** — optimal cosine schedule may differ under the new activation's convergence profile.
10. **Non-z-flip augmentations** (parked): x-translation, Re-jitter, inlet velocity perturbations — preserve ground-effect physics, no z-mirror needed.

## Dead-end lever classes (do not revisit in GELU regime)

1. **Z-flip augmentation family (ALL VARIANTS)** — #3542 naive, #3563 train-time naive, **#3724 corrected w/ sign-flips**. Ground-effect physics breaks z-symmetry for raceCar (no-slip wall at z=0). 3 independent failures across naive + corrected variants exhaust the family.
2. **SWA/EMA on frozen tail** — #3580, #3521. Needs non-frozen tail.
3. **Uniform surf_weight scan** — #3428, #3174, #3522.
4. **LLRD standard** — #3642. Inverted gradient profile in Transolver.
5. **unified_pos=True** — #3566. Incompatible with 2D asymmetric flow.
6. **Per-channel Huber-δ** — #3574. Loss-formulation exhausted.
7. **DropPath** — #3721. Regularization not bottleneck; gating (SwiGLU) was.
8. **Any h=128+GELU experiments** — val ceiling ~88 < new floor 65.44.

## Plateau status

**Decidedly not in plateau.** SwiGLU represents the first major architectural insight in this programme — switching from GELU to gated linear units gave a 28% relative val improvement. The SwiGLU era is just beginning; the programme is now exploring what stacks with gating.
