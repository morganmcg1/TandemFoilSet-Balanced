# SENPAI Research State — charlie-pai2d-r3

- **Date:** 2026-04-27
- **Advisor branch:** `icml-appendix-charlie-pai2d-r3`
- **Round:** 3 (8 idle students at start)

## Programme target

Beat the unmodified Transolver baseline on TandemFoilSet, ranked by
`val_avg/mae_surf_p` (val) and `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (test). The four val/test
tracks measure (a) in-distribution single-foil sanity, (b) unseen front-foil
camber for raceCar tandem, (c) unseen front-foil camber for cruise tandem,
(d) stratified Re holdout across all tandem domains. A useful change should
help across at least three of the four tracks.

## Round 3 focus

Open the round with a **breadth-first sweep** across orthogonal levers, since
this advisor branch carries no measured baseline yet. The eight assigned
hypotheses cover four families:

1. **Loss formulation that targets the reported MAE metric directly**
   (L1 surface loss, Huber surface loss, surface-channel reweighting).
2. **Model capacity in the directions the architecture is parameterised for**
   (wider+deeper Transolver, more PhysicsAttention slice tokens).
3. **Optimisation schedule in the regime the cosine baseline cannot reach**
   (LR warmup with higher peak, larger batch with sqrt LR scaling).
4. **Input representation that aids spatial generalisation across tracks**
   (multi-frequency Fourier features on node x/z position).

Each PR is a single-knob change so attribution is clean. The first round
identifies the dominant lever; round 4 will compose the winners.

## Potential next research directions

Following round 3, plausible next steps depending on which family wins:

- **If loss reformulation wins:** sweep weighting (5, 20, 40), per-channel
  pressure boost, switch volume loss to L1 too, MAE-targeted asymmetric loss.
- **If capacity wins:** push to `n_hidden=256` / `n_layers=8`, vary
  `slice_num` jointly with `n_hidden`, try more heads (8, 12).
- **If schedule wins:** OneCycleLR, longer warmup, larger T_max with lower
  floor LR, AdamW betas `(0.9, 0.95)` for transformer-style training.
- **If Fourier features win:** test learnable frequencies, RFF, NeRF-style
  multi-resolution, separate spatial vs feature encodings.
- **Cross-cutting:** loss + capacity composition, warmup + L1 stack, EMA of
  weights for evaluation, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM).
- **Architecture revisits if all r3 levers stall:** Transolver replacement
  with point-cloud transformer variants, GINO/FNO style spectral mixing in
  irregular meshes, hierarchical clustering of slice tokens.

## Constraints (do not override)

- 30-minute wallclock per training run (`SENPAI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`).
- 50-epoch cap (`--epochs 50` is the default; do not raise unless explicitly
  authorised).
- 96 GB GPU per student — VRAM headroom is large, lean on it for capacity.
- Local JSONL metrics only. No W&B / Weave / Wandb.
- One hypothesis per PR. No bundled multi-knob changes in round 3.
