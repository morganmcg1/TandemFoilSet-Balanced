## Current research focus

**Wave 17 — Optimizer-group axis + attention mechanisms + conditioning.**

The 17th compound win (learned-freqs-no-WD-10×lr) revealed that default optimizer settings systematically under-train scale/frequency parameters. This opens a broad new axis: **which other model parameters benefit from the same treatment?** Wave 17 tests 4 orthogonal hypotheses:
1. `freq-init-equilibrium` (frieren): start freqs at #2370 equilibrium, keep 10× lr — tests architectural vs dynamic component of the win
2. `learned-freqs-50x-lr` (thorfinn): test if top freqs [8,16,32] are strictly gradient-magnitude limited or lr-limited at 50×
3. `layerscale-lr-10x` (fern): LayerScale γ params in 10× lr no-WD group — same optimizer insight
4. `slice-temp-lr-10x` (nezuko): slice attention temperature params in 10× lr no-WD group

Parallel to these, still-in-flight experiments cover conditioning (FiLM #2368), hybrid Fourier (#2369), attention QK-norm (#2427), and asymmetric LayerScale (#2414).

## Key findings from Wave 13/14/15/16/17

**Gate activation axis (FULLY CLOSED at ReLU):**
- SiLU → GELU: **−4.75% val, −2.21% test** (14th compound win)
- GELU → ReLU: **−1.92% val, −4.07% test** (15th compound win)
- ReLU → Squared ReLU: **+5.19%** (CLOSED) — catastrophic
- ReLU → AbsGLU: **+10.35%** (#2385 CLOSED) — bidirectional gate destabilizes; one-sided dead zone is essential
- **Gate axis closed at ReGLU = max(0,x)**; triple-confirmed on negative side (AbsGLU, squared-ReLU both fail)

**Capacity axis (CLOSED):**
- inner_dim=256 (baseline) → 288 (MERGED, 16th win) → 320 (CLOSED #2386: +6.0%, overfit despite full budget)
- **inner_dim axis closed at 288**; bias-variance frontier confirmed between 288 and 320
- n_hidden: closed at 128 (#2371 +19.18%, quadratic scaling under 30-min budget)

**Encoder / Fourier axis:**
- Fixed dyadic freqs: closed at L=6
- Learnable freqs (#2370 MERGED, 17th win): −3.73% — bottom 3 freqs adapted strongly, top 3 gradient-limited
- **Wave 17 follow-ups**: freq init at equilibrium (frieren), 50× lr to unlock top freqs (thorfinn)

**Optimizer-group insight (Wave 17 new axis):**
- Scale/frequency parameters (freqs, LayerScale γ, slice temperature) may be systematically under-trained by default WD=1e-4 + lr=5e-4
- Putting freqs in no-WD + 10× lr group: +17th win (−3.73%)
- Testing same treatment for: LayerScale (fern), slice-temp (nezuko)

**Sampling axis (CLOSED for camber_rc upsampling):**
- OOD upsampling (#2391): +8.22% — camber_rc bottleneck is geometric extrapolation, NOT data density; upsampling collapses in-dist

| Gate: all except ReGLU | ReGLU (ReLU) | SiLU<GELU<ReLU<AbsGLU<SqReLU all tested; ReLU optimum |
| n_hidden (residual stream) | 128 | #2371: quadratic scaling, compute-bound |
| inner_dim | 288 | #2386: 320 over-fits; 256 under-fits |
| OOD domain upsampling (camber_rc) | equal weights | #2391: extrapolation gap, not density gap |
| EMA weights | off | Fights Fourier high-freq sharpening |
| Per-sample scalar Fourier | concat | #2286 class falsified |
| Hybrid dyadic+RFF σ=1.0 | dyadic L=6 | #2309 redundant low-freq overlap |

## Prioritized open research themes (Wave 17+)

1. **LayerScale lr-10x** (fern #2436): does the optimizer-group insight generalize from freqs to LayerScale γ?
2. **Slice temperature lr-10x** (nezuko #2437): does slice attention sharpness benefit from same treatment?
3. **Freq 50× lr** (thorfinn #2435): can top freqs be unlocked with higher lr?
4. **Freq equilibrium init** (frieren #2434): was the #2370 win architectural or dynamic?
5. **FiLM conditioning** (askeladd #2453): proper global conditioning for Re/AoA scalars (refreshed from stale #2368 on post-#2370 stack)
6. **Hybrid RFF + learned freqs** (edward #2441 NEW): additive Gaussian σ=3 RFF ON TOP of current learned-freqs stack — tests orthogonality of mechanisms
7. **QK-norm v2** (tanjiro #2427): with corrected init=0 and tau no-WD
8. **Asymmetric LayerScale** (alphonse #2414): attn=0.05, mlp=0.025
9. **All-param optimizer sweep**: if LayerScale + slice-temp both win, test joint 10× lr group for all scale params simultaneously
10. **Per-block learned freqs (30 params)**: natural escalation if 50× lr doesn't unlock top freqs
