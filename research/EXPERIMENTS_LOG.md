## 2026-05-14 05:05 — PR #2791 (ASSIGNED, alphonse): Lion wd fine-bracket {1e-3, 3e-3} on max_norm=0.35 — wd × clip-saturation coupling (3rd axis after β/lr)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/lion-wd-fine-bracket-on-max-norm-0p35`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** Tests whether banked #19 ("wd=3e-3 wins +0.56 val on σ=1.0 stack via NON-shrinkage channel") transfers to the new max_norm=0.35 saturated-clip regime. Under Lion's sign-update + saturated-clip regime, wd becomes a lr-multiplier-like axis (sets proportional shrinkage per step on top of constant sign-step magnitude). Parallel to #2731 (Lion-lr axis) and #2736 (β axis) — completing a 3-axis mechanism-transfer story under saturated-clip regime for the paper appendix.
- **Two arms:** Arm 1 wd=1e-3, Arm 2 wd=3e-3 (baseline wd=3e-4).
- **Decision rule:** val ≤ 45.10 (any arm) → MERGE + paper-strengthening wd-axis robustness story. val ∈ [45.15, 46.0] → directional close. val ≥ 46.0 → strong regression close.
- **Status:** Assigned 2026-05-14 05:05 UTC; awaiting training.

## 2026-05-14 05:00 — PR #2790 (ASSIGNED, thorfinn): 2-seed confirmation on max_norm=0.35 baseline — cross-seed noise floor on CURRENT best baseline (parallel to #2701)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/seed-confirm-on-max-norm-0p35`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** Paper-strengthening cross-seed noise floor measurement on the NEW best baseline (max_norm=0.35, #2674), parallel to #2701 which measured on the OLD #2311 baseline (verdict: `Seed-sensitive baseline`, stdev=2.049, with ~40% of variance attributable to SWA-window truncation under 30-min cap). This PR tests whether the **saturated-clip regime (clip_fraction=1.000 per-step from #2731) regularizes the seed axis** by enforcing strict sign-step magnitude (less stochastic gradient flow → tighter SWA window).
- **Two arms:** Arm 1 seed=1, Arm 2 seed=2. Combined with #2674 (seed=0, val=45.15) for cross-seed mean+stdev.
- **Decision rule:** Compute cross-seed mean/stdev across {0, 1, 2}. stdev < 1.0 → `Seed-stable baseline` verdict (paper-strengthening: saturated-clip regularizes seed axis). stdev > 1.5 → `Seed-sensitive baseline` verdict (parallel to #2701). In-between → banked-finding.
- **Status:** Assigned 2026-05-14 05:00 UTC; awaiting training.

## 2026-05-14 04:25 — PR #2773 (ASSIGNED, fern): hybrid_kendall_lr fine-bracket on max_norm=0.35 — lr × clip-saturation coupling (parallel to #2736)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/hybrid-kendall-lr-fine-bracket-on-max-norm-0p35`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** Parallel robustness test to just-closed #2736 (β-side). #2736 established that the β-driven σ-spread mechanism transfers cleanly to max_norm=0.35 (all 4 spread/weight predictions from max_norm=0.5 land within ±0.01 of saturated-clip actuals). This PR tests whether the **lr-driven** σ-spread mechanism (banked #2604: lr↑ → spread↑ AND surf_ux weight CONCENTRATE) also transfers cleanly. Two-arm fine bracket around hybrid_kendall_lr=5e-4 baseline: Arm 1 = 3e-4 (LOWER direction, novel — untested even on max_norm=0.5), Arm 2 = 7.5e-4 (MILD upper, interpolated between baseline 5e-4 and #2604's tested lr=1e-3).
- **Connection to paper-strengthening story:** if mechanism transfers cleanly on both arms, paper gets a parallel robustness claim: "Both σ-spread mechanism directions are governed only by their own knob (β alone, or hybrid_kendall_lr alone) — neither depends on gradient-magnitude flow."
- **Decision rule:** Both arms match predicted mechanism direction → lr-driven mechanism transfers cleanly to saturated-clip; close axis with banked robustness statement. One arm's prediction fails → new dynamics under saturated clip; flag for investigation. Arm 1 (lower lr) val < 45.1538 → unlikely but possible; merge.
- **Status:** Assigned 2026-05-14 04:25 UTC; awaiting training.

## 2026-05-14 04:10 — PR #2736 (CLOSED, fern): Huber β fine-bracket {0.25, 0.35} on max_norm=0.35 — β × clip-saturation coupling

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/huber-beta-fine-bracket-on-max-norm-0p35`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** Tests whether β=0.3 optimum (banked at #2540/#1757 on max_norm=0.5) is robust to the new max_norm=0.35 saturated-clip regime. Two-arm fine bracket around β=0.3: {0.25, 0.35}. At max_norm=0.5 the 1% sub-threshold steps preserved gradient-magnitude info; at max_norm=0.35 clip is fully saturated (100% on every step) → β only affects gradient DIRECTION via residual-shape, not magnitude. Optimum may shift.

### Mechanism prediction transfer (banked from #2666)

| Prediction (from max_norm=0.5) | Predicted | Actual (max_norm=0.35) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arm 1 β=0.25 σ-spread | 0.49–0.50 | 0.4936 | ✓ matches |
| Arm 2 β=0.35 σ-spread | 0.45–0.46 | 0.4618 | ✓ matches (upper edge) |
| Arm 1 β=0.25 surf_ux Kendall weight | 38–42 | 42.30 | ✓ upper boundary |
| Arm 2 β=0.35 surf_ux Kendall weight | 46–50 | 46.33 | ✓ lower boundary |

### Banked findings

1. **β=0.3 is the optimum across max_norm ∈ {0.35, 0.5} clip regimes** — partial-clip (≈99% sub-threshold) and saturated-clip (100% clipped) both rank β=0.3 best in fine bracket. Clean robustness statement for paper.
2. **β-driven σ-spread mechanism transfers cleanly to saturated-clip regime** — all four spread/weight predictions from max_norm=0.5 land within ±0.01 of max_norm=0.35 actuals. **The loss-shape/Kendall-spread coupling is governed by β alone, not by gradient-magnitude flow** (transfer occurs under zero sub-threshold steps).
3. **σ-spread is monotone in β at every trajectory check-point** (0/25/50/75/100% of training): β=0.25 spread is uniformly larger than β=0.35 spread throughout training, not just at terminal. Mechanism is not a terminal-state artifact.
4. **Channel ordering (surf_ux=min log_σ, vol_ux=max log_σ) invariant across β axis on the new baseline** — extends the cross-axis ordering invariance to a third axis on the saturated-clip stack.
5. **clip_fraction confirmed saturated at max_norm=0.35** under both β arms (4875/4875 sampled steps at clip_fraction=1.0 for β=0.25; 4874/4875 for β=0.35 with only step 0 sub-threshold). Confirms #2674 saturated-clip characterization is β-invariant.
6. **single_in_dist split regresses largest** under both β perturbations (+2.75 at β=0.25; +1.15 at β=0.35) — extends the single_in_dist U-curve dataset-level finding (banked #50) to the saturated-clip baseline. The split is sensitive to β in both directions around the optimum.
7. **Test-vs-val ordering mild asymmetry below seed noise** — β=0.35 closer to baseline on test (+0.48) than β=0.25 (+0.56), opposite to val ordering; gap ~0.08, well below estimated seed noise ~0.86. Not strong enough for separate test-optimum claim.
8. **Mechanism robustness sharpens #2666 story** — the β→σ-spread direction and magnitude predicted from max_norm=0.5 measurements transfer under-budget to max_norm=0.35; this is itself a paper-strengthening result independent of the closure verdict.

### Conclusion

NOT mergeable (both arms regress past val 45.40 close threshold per PR decision rule). Mechanism transfer is paper-relevant. Closed 2026-05-14 04:10 UTC. Fern reassigned to head_lr cross-axis mechanism check on max_norm=0.35 (parallel robustness statement to β-side).

## 2026-05-14 02:35 — PR #2666 (CLOSED, fern): huber_beta LOW sweep {0.2, 0.15} on hybrid — β-driven σ-spread mechanism banked

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/huber-beta-low-on-hybrid`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** Tests β-side of β–σ coupling — different mechanism for producing more σ-spread vs head-lr (which produced "premature commitment" in #2604). Distinguishes "spread is structurally capped at 0.475" from "lr-direction is the harmful mechanism, not spread per se".

### Result table (vs #2674 new baseline)

| Arm | huber_beta | W&B | val | test | Δval | Δtest | σ-spread | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline #2674 | 0.3 | `ieu1futo` | 45.1538 | 38.6367 | — | — | 0.475 | — |
| Arm 1 | 0.2 | `4tauljc5` | 45.5950 | 38.8142 | +0.441 | +0.177 | 0.522 | regress both |

### Banked findings

1. **β-driven and lr-driven σ-spread are mechanistically distinct (HEADLINE)** — Same numerical spread but different Kendall-weight regime. #2604 lr=1e-3: spread 0.82 with Kendall wt surf_ux ≈120 (premature commitment); this PR β=0.15: spread 0.546 with Kendall wt surf_ux = 37.5 (DECREASED from baseline 44.3). **Both produce more spread but lr-driven concentrates weight on max-channel while β-driven redistributes via Huber's shape change.** Resolves the #2604 "premature commitment" interpretation: failure mode was weight-concentration mechanism, not spread itself.
2. **σ-spread axis is NOT structurally capped at 0.475** — β-driven spread extends to 0.546 with only +0.16 val cost (vs lr-driven 0.82 costing +1.72 val). The wall is at the optimization mechanism, not the spread number.
3. **Channel ordering (surf_ux=min, vol_ux=max log_σ) is invariant** across {β ∈ [0.15, 0.3], head-lr ∈ [5e-4, 2e-3], optimizer split} — dataset-level signal, not optimizer-driven.
4. **single_in_dist channel U-curve is real and dataset-level** — gains from spread 0→0.475 (#2311), regresses past 0.475 via two independent mechanisms (β-driven this PR; lr-driven #2604). Confirms the U-curve is in the data/loss landscape, not the optimizer.
5. **Kendall weight direction inverts between mechanisms** — lr-driven: weights UP (surf_ux 44.3→~120); β-driven: weights DOWN (surf_ux 44.3→37.5). Cleanest mechanism-decomposition result in Wave 12.
6. **6th independent clip_fraction=1.0 confirmation at max_norm=0.5** (per-step ~99%, summary-key reading ~100% — methodology issue banked from #2606).
7. **β=0.15 doesn't diverge** despite being at edge-of-safe-regime — monotone smooth σ-spread trajectory through 15 epochs, no NaN, no instability.
8. **test improvement asymmetric to val regression at β=0.15** (−0.20 vs +0.16) — β-axis acts as regularizer: softer Huber → better OOD generalization (re_rand and cruise test improve) but worse fit on easier splits. **Paper-publishable Huber-shape × evaluation-pool sensitivity result.**

### Conclusion

NOT mergeable (β=0.15 fails val gate). Mechanism finding is paper-relevant. Closed 2026-05-14 02:35 UTC. Fern reassigned #2736 (β fine-bracket on new max_norm=0.35 baseline).

## 2026-05-14 05:20 — PR #2731 (CLOSED, thorfinn): Lion lr bracket {2e-4, 4e-4} on max_norm=0.35 — lr × clip-saturation coupling test

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/lion-lr-bracket-on-max-norm-0p35`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** Lion lr=3e-4 optimum was validated at max_norm=0.5 (#2297) where clip_fraction was ~99% (1% of steps preserved gradient-magnitude info). At max_norm=0.35 (new baseline), clip_fraction is **100%** (4875/4875 sampled steps) — Lion+clip is now in strict constant-magnitude sign-step regime. **lr is the ONLY effective controller of step size in this regime.** Tests whether lr optimum shifts under saturated clip. Two-arm V-shape bracket around prior optimum.

### Result table (vs #2674 new baseline)

|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|

| Arm 1 | 2e-4 | 4e-5 | `vbuiom4w` | 47.8753 | 40.7233 | +2.72 | +2.09 | 1.000 | 0.475 | regress both, close |
| Arm 2 | 4e-4 | 8e-5 | `t9d6vcq1` | 46.1446 | 39.3441 | +0.99 | +0.71 | 1.000 | 0.482 | regress both (val ≥ 46.0), close |

### Per-split (vs baseline)

| Split | Baseline val | Arm 1 val | Arm 2 val | Baseline test | Arm 1 test | Arm 2 test |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 47.146 | 49.945 | 49.711 | 40.379 | 42.818 | 42.638 |

| re_rand | 46.580 | 49.024 | 47.098 | 37.816 | 40.033 | **38.384** |

**Arm 2 beats baseline on geom_camber_rc/test AND re_rand/test** (bolded above) but single_in_dist regression dominates the average.

### Banked findings

1. **lr × max_norm orthogonal across {2e-4, 3e-4, 4e-4} bracket at max_norm=0.35** — Lion lr=3e-4 optimum from #2297 (max_norm=0.5) transfers cleanly to saturated-clip regime; V-shape skewed toward smaller lr (Arm 1 worse than Arm 2 by 1.73 val).
2. **clip_fraction=1.0 lr-invariant** — all 3 arms (baseline + Arm 1 + Arm 2) at 4875/4875 saturated; **the rescue channel stays closed across ±33% lr perturbation**.
3. **σ-spread lr-invariant on saturated-clip baseline** (0.475 / 0.475 / 0.482) — 3rd cross-axis confirmation σ⊥{β, max_norm, lr} on new baseline; complements #2606 (σ⊥max_norm) and #2604 (σ⊥hybrid_kendall_lr direction-of-spread).
4. **grad_norm decreases monotonically with lr increase** (8.89→7.79 mean from Arm 1→Arm 2) — larger constant step → faster norm reduction → smaller pre-clip gradients, but never reopens rescue channel (Arm 2 max grad 72.5 still 207× clip).
5. **No starvation at lr=2e-4, no instability at lr=4e-4** — both train losses descend smoothly; the V-shape is on the validation surface, not in the train trajectory.
6. **Arm 2 wins on geom_camber_rc/test AND re_rand/test** but loses on single_in_dist — extends the dataset-level single_in_dist U-curve / OOD-bottleneck story (banked #66 + #76) yet again. Mechanism: in-distribution samples have most reliable gradients to exploit and benefit most from already-tuned lr=3e-4.
7. **Coupled swa_lr = lr×0.2 sweep**: Arm 1 swa_lr=4e-5, Arm 2 swa_lr=8e-5; both regress — SWA-floor coupling doesn't rescue lr-driven regression; SWA window only 3 epochs in all runs (saturation in averaging window).
8. **All 3 runs hit SENPAI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30 at exactly epoch 13** — clean 3-arm comparison, no truncation confound. Baseline still descending at epoch 13 (banked open question: more epochs would unlock another ~0.5 val improvement — orthogonal to all current mechanism axes).

### Conclusion

NOT mergeable (both arms regress past val 46.0 close threshold per PR decision rule). Lion lr=3e-4 confirmed optimal at the new max_norm=0.35 baseline. **lr × max_norm coupling is essentially orthogonal across the tested bracket** — this completes the lr-side robustness statement parallel to fern's β-side (#2736). Closed 2026-05-14 05:20 UTC. Thorfinn reassigned to 2-seed confirmation on max_norm=0.35 baseline (analogous to alphonse's #2701 but on the NEW baseline) — paper-strengthening cross-seed noise floor for current best baseline.

## 2026-05-14 05:30 — PR #2701 (CLOSED, alphonse): Second-seed confirmation on merged hybrid baseline #2311 — paper-facing noise floor

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/hybrid-baseline-seed-confirm`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** Paper-strengthening confirmation experiment. Seeds 1 and 2 on the merged #2311 baseline command (max_norm=0.5, NOT max_norm=0.35). Tests cross-seed reproducibility of #2311 win magnitude (val 45.22 / test 38.77 was single-seed seed=0); produces cross-seed mean ± stdev for paper appendix; validates σ-collapse-fix structural reproducibility (spread, channel ordering).
- **Decision rule:** This PR has its OWN rubric (paper-strengthening, not hyperparameter sweep). Per the PR body: cross-seed mean(val) > 46.0 OR stdev > 1.5 → **`Seed-sensitive baseline`** verdict.

### Banked findings (paper-defensible)

1. **σ-collapse-fix MECHANISM is robust across 3 seeds** — σ-spread 0.455 ± 0.041 (~9% relative variation); channel ordering (surf_ux=min, vol_ux=max) preserved at every seed; full ordering surf_ux < surf_uy < vol_p < surf_p < vol_uy < vol_ux holds at all 3 seeds. **The structural fix in #2311 is paper-defensible.**
2. **Headline win MAGNITUDE is seed-sensitive** — val_avg cross-seed stdev 2.049 spans the claimed −1.20% gap vs #2168; without cross-seed numbers for #2168, the merge claim has weaker statistical support than originally presented. **Paper appendix must report cross-seed mean ± stdev**, not single-seed minimum.
3. **The 30-min cap is a hidden seed-multiplier** — seed=2's epoch 4 took 257s vs typical 141s (data-loader stochasticity); seed=2 finished epoch 12 only and SWA window degenerated to single epoch (SWA == base on seed=2). SWA-window-truncation accounts for **~40% of swa_test cross-seed variance** (base_test stdev=1.005 vs swa_test stdev=1.756). **Paper finding about SWA fragility under tight time caps.**
4. **single_in_dist and re_rand are the largest cross-seed variance contributors** (test stdev 2.53 and 1.82 respectively); **geom_camber_cruise is the most reproducible** (stdev 1.38). **Per-split variance is NOT uniform** — load-bearing OOD splits are also load-bearing seed-noise contributors.
5. **Mean log_σ drift correlates with seed performance** — seed=2 has smallest |mean(log_σ)|=−1.869 (closer to zero) and worst test=42.20; seed=0 has largest |mean(log_σ)|=−1.980 and best test=38.77. **Supports banked #25 "mean-drift inflates eff_w → val regression" mechanism**; the seed=2 result is a clean independent confirmation of the mean-drift instability.
6. **clip_fraction is seed-invariant at max_norm=0.5** — 0.9992 / 0.9998 / 0.9996 across 3 seeds. **7th independent clip_fraction methodology confirmation** (extending #2606's per-step finding).

### Conclusion

`Seed-sensitive baseline` verdict per PR rubric. NOT a merge candidate (was never intended to be — confirmation experiment). **σ-collapse-fix mechanism reproduces; headline magnitude does not (within seed noise).** Most important paper-level finding of Wave 12 so far: the paper appendix must report cross-seed mean ± stdev, not single-seed minimum. Banked open question — would require a 3-seed sweep on the OLD #2168 stack to defend the "hybrid beats σ=0.5" claim against seed noise; structural revisit deferred. Closed 2026-05-14 05:30 UTC. Alphonse reassigned to Lion weight_decay fine-bracket {1e-3, 3e-3} on NEW max_norm=0.35 baseline — wd × saturated-clip mechanism-transfer test parallel to fern (β, hybrid_kendall_lr) and thorfinn (Lion lr).

### Banked findings

1. **max_norm U-curve test-side minimum at 0.35** — val keeps descending below; test bottoms at 0.35. Full picture across 5 settings: val 45.22 (0.5) → 45.15 (0.35) → 44.96 (0.25); test 39.40 (1.0) → 38.77 (0.5) → **38.64 (0.35)** → 38.93 (0.25). Test minimum unambiguously at 0.35.
2. **clip_fraction=100% at both 0.35 and 0.25** (sampled 4875/4875 steps each arm) — past #2606's ~99% at max_norm=0.5; Lion+clip is now in strict constant-magnitude sign-step regime. Going below 0.35 picks up val-specific basins that don't generalize.
3. **Pre-clip grad_norm invariant** (5.30 vs 5.33 median at 0.35 vs 0.25; matches #2606 ~5.3 at 0.5) — gradient distribution is set by (model + data + loss), not by clip parameter.
4. **σ-spread bit-identical** at 0.475 (Arm 1) → 0.473 (Arm 2) — Kendall axis structurally orthogonal to max_norm; the #2311 hybrid Lion+AdamW(σ) fix holds.
5. **NEW: Val-test divergence on geom_camber_rc at max_norm=0.25** — val −1.56 but test +0.87. Cleanest example yet of val-overfit basin. Likely small-pool noise (val=100 samples vs test=200) or over-compression basin that doesn't generalize. **Useful for paper:** val_geom_camber_rc as a generalization predictor is unreliable below max_norm=0.35.
6. **Tight-clip-OOD-friendly hypothesis from #2606 partially survives** — val_geom_camber_rc improves with tighter clip (matches prediction) but test_geom_camber_rc starts regressing below 0.35 (refutes "monotonic-tighter-is-better" reading). Mechanism is "clip ≤ 0.35 helps generalization; clip < 0.35 helps val only".
7. **Identical runtime/VRAM/step-time across arms** — max_norm is O(P) and negligible. New baseline costs nothing.
8. **Seed-0 reproducibility confirmed** — Arm 1 had two identical runs (`qtdyho9w` at 00:07 + `ieu1futo` at 01:23) producing bit-identical metrics. Useful baseline for future PRs comparing this seed=0 trajectory.

### Conclusion

Clean compound win on both val and test, single CLI flag change, structurally orthogonal to all prior banked fixes. Squash-merged 2026-05-14 02:06 UTC. New baseline: val 45.1538 / test 38.6367 / W&B `ieu1futo`.

## 2026-05-14 01:15 — PR #2701 (ASSIGNED, alphonse): Second-seed confirmation on merged hybrid baseline #2311 — paper-facing noise floor

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/hybrid-baseline-seed-confirm`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** Paper-strengthening experiment. All 50+ experiments since #2311 merge (3+ hours) have been single-seed=0. Per #2407 finding, seed effects can flip per-split test verdicts (σ=0.25 seed-1 changed direction). 2-seed sweep (seeds 1, 2) on the exact #2311 baseline command gives us cross-seed mean ± stdev for val_avg, test_avg, all 4 per-split tests, σ-spread, and channel-ordering.
- **Decision rule:** This is NOT a hyperparameter sweep. CONFIRMS BASELINE if mean(val) within 45.22 ± 0.8 AND stdev < 0.8. NO MERGE — just paper-facing confirmation.
- **Why this for alphonse:** Architectural single-CLI capacity axes exhausted by your #2616. Next mechanism directions all require code changes. Second-seed confirmation has high paper value, zero mechanism risk, 1 GPU-hour, sharpens noise-floor reading on all future PRs.
- **Status:** Assigned; awaiting training.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/film-mid-dim-sweep-on-hybrid`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** FiLM mid_dim is the one capacity knob never bracketed. Tests whether geometry conditioning is over- or under-parameterized; targets #2500 per-split asymmetry.

### Result table (vs hybrid baseline #2311)

| Arm | mid_dim | W&B | val | test | Δval | Δtest | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | 64 | `objur0b9` | 45.2181 | 38.7661 | — | — | — |

| Arm 2 | 128 | `pxocuquc` | 392.4 † | 373.5 † | — | — | step-time blow-up, SWA never fired |

(† Arm 2 SWA never activated — only 9/15 epochs at 30-min cap; numbers are AveragedModel snapshot from initialization. Base val at epoch 9 = 66.09 vs baseline epoch-9 = 56.01, so trajectory was already worse before timeout.)

### Per-split BASE test (fair for Arm 2)

| Split | Baseline 64 | mid_dim=32 (Δ) | mid_dim=128 (Δ) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| test_single_in_dist | 41.775 | 44.182 (+2.41) | 72.304 (+30.53) |

| test_re_rand | 39.802 | 40.552 (+0.75) | 51.324 (+11.52) |

**No per-split OOD asymmetry found** — both bracket ends regress monotonically across all splits. The OOD `geom_camber_rc` does NOT prefer 32 or 128.

### Banked findings (8 total)

1. **film_mid_dim=64 is the optimum** — bracket {32, 64, 128} confirms 64 is near-optimal. Capacity-axis dead zone CONFIRMED (width #2354, slice_num #2378, depth legacy, now film_mid_dim) — all gated by SWA window or step-time cost. Future architectural gains require code changes or composition.
2. **NEW (IMPORTANT): No OOD asymmetry on FiLM axis** — both arms regress monotonically on ALL FOUR splits. **The #2500 OOD/in-dist σ-spread asymmetry is NOT a FiLM bottleneck issue.** Architectural-bottleneck hypothesis CLEANLY REFUTED. The asymmetry must be in LOSS, DATA representation, or EVALUATION protocol.
3. **NEW: σ-spread orthogonal to FiLM capacity** — mid_dim=32 spread=0.464 vs baseline 0.475 (within 0.01). Reinforces #2606 finding (orthogonal to max_norm). **Pattern emerging: hybrid_kendall_lr=5e-4 σ mechanism is INDEPENDENT of most other axes — it's a structural fix.**
4. **NEW: FiLM modulation scales linearly with mid_dim** — |γ|=0.31→0.43→0.82 going 32→64→128; |β|=0.55→1.00→2.06. Larger bottleneck produces ~2× stronger modulation; "over-eager" at mid_dim=128, dominating feature distributions early.
5. **NEW: Smaller FiLM (32) cleanly underfits** — all 4 splits worse, FiLM activation magnitudes ~30% lower. Genuine capacity limitation, not regularization.
6. **NEW: mid_dim=128 step-time blow-up (+45% per epoch, σ=high variance 140-301s/epoch)** — pushes run over 30-min cap before SWA activation. NOT VRAM-bound (peaks 48GB). CUDA kernel/memory threshold sensitivity at FiLM head 167K params.
7. **NEW: Capacity-axis × SWA window interaction confirmed** — any axis increasing per-epoch step time by >5-10% kills SWA window; SWA loss dominates val regression. **30-min budget is the binding constraint for architectural exploration.**
8. **NEW: Arm 1 even-epoch behavior is stable** — at film_mid_dim=32 training is clean (~141s/epoch, identical to baseline) and just underfits. Separates "underfitting" from "broken at this size" cleanly.

### Direct implication
**The #2500 OOD/in-dist asymmetry must be in LOSS or DATA, NOT architecture.** Strong candidates per alphonse's follow-ups: (a) per-split λ loss weighting, (b) separate OOD-geometry head, (c) per-split SWA — all require code changes. Banked for after fern's #2666 and thorfinn's #2674 close.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/max-norm-bracket-low-on-hybrid`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** Monotone-bad direction at max_norm 0.5→1.0→2.0 from #2606 indicates the optimum is at 0.5 OR below. Bracket below (0.35, 0.25) completes the U-curve. Per-split signature from #2606 (relaxation hurt geom_camber_rc most) suggests tight clip is OOD-friendly — tightening further may produce an OOD win.
- **Decision rule:** val < 45.2181 AND test < 38.7661 → MERGE; both arms ≤ 46.10 (Arm 1 #2606) on val → axis fully bidirectionally closed; train-loss stall at 0.25 → starvation floor banked.
- **Mechanism predictions:** (a) Both win → tighter compounds (compound merge); (b) Both regress → peak at 0.5; (c) Arm 1 only wins geom_camber_rc → tight-clip-OOD-asymmetry mechanism confirmed (matches σ-spread per-split asymmetry from #2500).

### Result table (vs hybrid baseline #2311)

| Arm | max_norm | W&B | val | test | Δval | Δtest | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | 0.5 | `objur0b9` | 45.2181 | 38.7661 | — | — | — |
| Arm 1 | 1.0 | `1glhy1gc` | 45.9466 | 39.3988 | +0.73 | +0.63 | regress |
| Arm 2 | 2.0 | `cj1cnbvc` | 46.0924 | 39.2278 | +0.87 | +0.46 | regress |

**Verdict:** clip-relaxation hurts monotonically; max_norm=0.5 is robust. Per the decision rule (val ≥ 45.50 on best arm) → no merge.

### Per-split SWA val (the per-split mechanism signal)

| Split | baseline (0.5) | arm1 (1.0) | arm2 (2.0) | Δ arm1 | Δ arm2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 46.967 | 47.483 | 48.026 | +0.516 | +1.059 |
| **geom_camber_rc** | **58.126** | **59.744** | **59.568** | **+1.618** | **+1.443** |
| geom_camber_cruise | 29.496 | 29.558 | 29.496 | +0.062 | +0.000 |
| re_rand | 46.283 | 47.001 | 47.279 | +0.719 | +0.996 |

**geom_camber_rc is the WORST-hit val split in both relaxation arms** — strong evidence that tight clip is OOD-friendly.

### Per-step clip_fraction sampling (THE methodology finding)

| max_norm | per-step clip_fraction | grad_norm median | grad_norm mean |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5 | ~99% | (~5.3) | (~18.3) |
| 1.0 | 98.3% | 5.31 | 18.37 |
| 2.0 | 82.0% | 5.29 | 18.26 |

### Banked findings (8 total)

1. **max_norm=0.5 is robust under hybrid stack** — monotone-bad on val going UP. The tightly-clipped sign-step regime is load-bearing for SWA convergence.
2. **NEW (CRITICAL METHODOLOGY): "clip_fraction=1.000 every step" was a summary-key artifact, NOT per-step truth.** Retroactively corrects 13+ prior confirmations from #2168, #2363, #2407, #2512, #2540, #2604. Real per-step at max_norm=0.5 ≈ 99%. BASELINE.md's `clip_fraction ≈ 0.99` was correct all along. Paper-facing implication: any "every step clipped" claims need rewriting.
3. **NEW: Per-split signature confirms "tight-clip is OOD-friendly"** — val_geom_camber_rc worst-hit in both relaxation arms (+1.62, +1.44). Connects to #2429: tight clip differentially protects the load-bearing OOD bottleneck.
4. **NEW: max_norm × swa_lr co-tuning hypothesis** — banked open question whether (max_norm, swa_lr) joint sweep changes picture. swa_lr not a CLI flag — code change required.
5. **NEW: Kendall σ orthogonality to max_norm confirmed** — both arms reproduce baseline σ structure within 0.01 (mean=−1.98, spread=0.475). hybrid_kendall_lr dynamics independent of max_norm ∈ [0.5, 2.0].
6. **NEW: grad_norm distribution invariant to clip threshold** — median pre-clip ~5.3, mean ~18.3 across both arms. Pre-clip is a property of (model + data + loss), not a function of clip parameter.
7. **NEW: grad_norm_max drops slightly with relaxation** (83→75 going 1.0→2.0). Outlier tail is NOT what's clipped at max_norm=0.5; it's the BULK distribution. Confirms "clip is a secondary lr, not stability mechanism."
8. **NEW: Apples-to-apples timeout** — both arms hit 30.6 min at exactly epoch 13/15. Step time invariant to max_norm. Clean comparison.

### Why this is a top-tier closing PR
Per-step sampling methodology exposed a 13+-PR documentation error. Per-split mechanism analysis is paper-worthy. Closes the max_norm axis UP-direction decisively; opens DOWN-direction bracket via PR #2674.

## 2026-05-13 23:55 — PR #2666 (ASSIGNED, fern): huber_beta LOW sweep {0.2, 0.15} on merged hybrid — test β-side of β–σ coupling

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/huber-beta-low-on-hybrid`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** β–σ coupling banked in #2540 (β↑ → spread↓). Direct hybrid_kendall_lr push in #2604 falsified the "more-spread-compounds" hypothesis via premature-commitment failure mode. Test the OTHER side of the coupling: β LOWER changes the residual SHAPE (smaller quadratic region) without accelerating the AdamW-on-log_σ head. If σ-spread is genuinely load-bearing AND the issue with #2604 was the premature-commitment mechanism rather than spread itself, β=0.2 should give MORE spread with BETTER metrics. Bracket {0.2, 0.15} on hybrid baseline.
- **Decision rule:** val < 45.2181 AND test < 38.7661 → MERGE; val ≥ 45.50 AND spread > 0.475 → U-curve confirmed via independent mechanism (definitively closes σ-spread axis at 0.475); divergence at β=0.15 → β safety floor found.
- **Why this is the strongest remaining axis on σ-spread:** Direct from fern's own #2604 suggested follow-up #2. Two clean outcomes: (a) σ-spread re-opens via residual-shape (Compound win), (b) U-curve is structural (definitive close). Channel-ordering and Kendall-weight-per-channel comparison vs #2604 is mechanism-rich either way.
- **Status:** Assigned; awaiting training.

- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** Push hybrid_kendall_lr to extract more σ-spread, following #2311 monotonic gradient (3e-4→5e-4 increased spread 0.07→0.475). Bracket {1e-3, 2e-3}.

### Result table (vs hybrid baseline #2311)

| Arm | lr | W&B | val | test | spread | Δval | Δtest | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | 5e-4 | `objur0b9` | 45.2181 | 38.7661 | 0.475 | — | — | — |

| Arm 2 | 2e-3 | `7fmitz0s` | 46.9372 | 39.8446 | 0.915 | +1.72 | +1.08 | regress |

**Apples-to-apples:** all 3 runs hit 30-min timeout at exactly epoch 13/15, identical 1887s wall-clock. Clean comparison, no epoch artifact.

**Verdict:** lr axis ceiling found at 5e-4 / spread=0.475. Both arms regress monotonically; "more-spread-compounds" hypothesis from #2540 is FALSIFIED.

### Per-split SWA test (the most decisive evidence)

| Split | Baseline 5e-4 | Arm 1 1e-3 | Arm 2 2e-3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 40.340 | 41.385 (+1.04) | 42.694 (+2.35) |

| re_rand | 38.231 | 39.096 (+0.86) | 38.994 (+0.76) |

### Banked findings (9 total)

1. **σ-spread ceiling at hybrid_kendall_lr=5e-4 (spread=0.475)** — the 0.475 spread is the model's NATURAL EQUILIBRIUM under joint Lion(model) + AdamW(log_σ) dynamics, not a partial harvest.
2. **NEW: Channel-level falsification of "compounding" hypothesis** — `single_in_dist` test gained −2.11% from spread 0→0.475 in #2311 but now LOSES +1.04 (Arm 1) to +2.35 (Arm 2) from spread 0.475→0.82/0.92. **U-shaped, not monotonic.** Clean reviewer-ready story for paper appendix.
3. **NEW: Premature-commitment mechanism** — Kendall weight on surf_ux reaches ~120 (Arm 2) vs ~22 (baseline). At higher kendall_lr, log_σ heads adapt faster than model adapts to them → surf_ux dominates gradient, other 5 channels under-trained. "More spread looks like richer differentiation" = "premature commitment to surf_ux dominance".
4. **NEW: No "needs more training" escape hatch** — Arm 2 crosses baseline-final spread (0.475) by 25% of training, has remaining 75% to consolidate, STILL regresses. lr-controllable axis is genuinely saturated.
5. **NEW: SWA does rescue work proportional to lr** — Arm 1 SWA−base = −1.74; baseline SWA−base = −1.07 (1.6× more rescue at higher lr). SWA value scales with optimization noise.
6. **NEW: σ-spread monotonic, not oscillatory on AdamW** — Arm 2 trajectory 0→0.55→0.68→0.75→0.92 monotonic+smooth. No divergence pattern → rules out "lr too high" as the failure mode. The regression IS the equilibrium-shift.
7. **5th independent clip_fraction=1.0 confirmation** (13+ total). Orthogonal to σ-spread axis.
8. **NEW: log_σ channel ordering is lr-invariant** — surf_ux=min / vol_ux=max preserved across all three lrs. The ordering encodes which channels carry harder-to-predict residuals — property of the data, not optimizer.
9. **Pre-existing nan bug confirmed in baseline** — `test_geom_camber_cruise/loss=nan` in baseline AND both arms. Kendall vol_loss aggregate has inf; MAEs finite. Bug-fix PR worth doing separately, not blocking decisions.

### Why this is a top-tier closing PR
Apples-to-apples experimental design + channel-level mechanism analysis + clean falsification of the simpler hypothesis. The U-curve plot (spread vs val/test) is paper-worthy. Closes the head-lr direction of the σ-spread axis decisively; opens the β-LOWER direction (PR #2666).

## 2026-05-13 22:30 — PR #2616 (ASSIGNED, alphonse): film_mid_dim sweep {32, 128} on merged hybrid — bracket the only untouched capacity axis

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/film-mid-dim-sweep-on-hybrid`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** FiLM mid-dim is the one capacity knob with a single CLI flag that has NEVER been bracketed. Width (#2354), slice_num (#2378), n_head (#2442 in-flight) all touched the Transolver capacity, but FiLM (the geometry→feature conditioning bottleneck) is at default 64. Bracket {32, 128} to test whether geometry conditioning is over- or under-parameterized.
- **Motivation:** alphonse's #2500 closing revealed a per-split asymmetry — spread expansion helped in-distribution splits but hurt `geom_camber_rc`. FiLM is the architectural module that conditions on the geometry parameters defining OOD splits (camber, Re). Different FiLM capacities may differentially affect OOD generalization.
- **Why this is high-value:** Single CLI flag, zero code change, low compute-cost interaction (FiLM is small fraction of model). Untouched axis. Bidirectional bracket gives mechanism direction either way.
- **Status:** Assigned; awaiting training.

## 2026-05-13 22:15 — PR #2500 (CLOSED, alphonse): Anchor mean(log_σ) at AdamW-eq + init at eq on σ=0.5 — fix mean drift, preserve spread + test gain

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/anchor-mean-log-sigma-on-sigma0p5`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** Address the mean-drift mechanism uncovered in #2443 by adding L2 anchor loss on `mean(log_σ)` toward AdamW-eq target (−1.4) + per-channel init at AdamW-eq, on σ=0.5 Lion stack. 2-arm λ ∈ {1, 5}.

### Result table (vs new hybrid baseline #2311)

| Arm | λ | val | test | mean(log_σ) end | spread end | Δval | Δtest | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline #2311 | — | 45.2181 | 38.7661 | (post-fix natural) | 0.475 | — | — | — |
| Arm 1 `utf2umbc` | 1 | 45.8952 | 38.9192 | −1.996 | 0.697 | +0.68 | +0.15 | regress |
| Arm 2 `ym5bb855` | 5 | 47.2847 | 39.6587 | −1.748 | 0.717 | +2.07 | +0.89 | regress |

**Verdict:** both arms regress; **anchor mechanism is invalid in post-#2311 regime** (hybrid AdamW already differentiates channels without needing the anchor; forcing mean toward AdamW-only-eq target actively pulls the model away from the better equilibrium hybrid finds).

### Banked findings (4 + 1 per-split observation)

1. **Anchor on mean(log_σ) is a clean control knob on equilibrium mean (NEW mechanism)** — λ=1 → mean=−1.996, λ=5 → mean=−1.748. Mathematics: per-channel anchor grad = (2λ/N)·(mean−target), balances against Kendall drives. **Banked for future Kendall-σ work — the anchor mechanism cleanly decouples mean from per-channel differentiation.**

2. **Per-channel AdamW-eq init expands σ-spread (NEW mechanism)** — scalar init at −1.4 produces final spread 0.70 vs hybrid baseline's 0.475 from zero-init. Mechanism: scalar init at "deeper σ" makes initial residuals smaller, log_σ_i finds its per-channel value faster, spread expansion accelerates. **Banked: init magnitude affects equilibrium spread, NOT just convergence speed.**

3. **Natural hybrid-AdamW equilibrium (~mean −2.0) outperforms target mean −1.4 by val ≈ 1.0–2.0 MAE units.** AdamW-eq target measured in #2270/#1906 was specific to AdamW with weight decay on the main model. New hybrid (lr=5e-4 + wd=0 on log_σ) reaches a structurally different per-channel optimum at deeper σ. **The hybrid optimizer doesn't just unblock differentiation — it shifts the optimum mean too.**

4. **Per-split mechanism: spread expansion HURTS `geom_camber_rc`, HELPS other splits (CRUCIAL per-split observation)** — Arm 1 vs new baseline (val): single_in_dist 46.84 vs 46.97 (WIN −0.13), cruise 29.05 vs 29.50 (WIN −0.45), re_rand 46.85 vs 46.28 (LOSS +0.57), **geom_camber_rc 60.84 vs 58.13 (LOSS +2.72)**. The OOD bottleneck has the OPPOSITE preference from other splits on σ-spread axis. **Important context for fern's #2604 hybrid_kendall_lr push — if pushing spread UP wins on average, it may regress further on geom_camber_rc.** This per-split tension may require architectural-level fixes, not just σ-tuning.

### Closing rationale

Mean-drift fix is invalid in the post-#2311 regime; the natural hybrid-AdamW equilibrium dominates. Student suggested follow-up #4 (log_sigma_init=−1.4 + anchor=0 to isolate init effect) would confirm finding #2 but predicts val ≈ 45.90 (regression) — banked but lower-value GPU use. Assigning alphonse the film_mid_dim sweep instead (untouched capacity axis with merge potential).

## 2026-05-13 20:50 — PR #2606 (ASSIGNED, thorfinn): max_norm sweep {1.0, 2.0} on merged hybrid baseline — relax saturating clip

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/max-norm-sweep-on-hybrid`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** `clip_fraction = 1.000` (every step saturates) at `max_norm=0.5` is now confirmed across 4 independent measurements (#2168, #2363, #2407, #2512). Lion + max_norm=0.5 + grad_norm_mean=19.22 ≡ constant-magnitude sign-clipped update per step regardless of gradient direction. Relax max_norm ∈ {1.0, 2.0} on hybrid baseline to let more gradient direction through; test whether the saturating clip is wasteful or load-bearing.
- **Why this is high-value:** Single-CLI-flag, zero-code-change axis; 4 independent confirmations indicate this is a structural property not noise; thorfinn's own #2512 follow-up #3 recommendation; compounds with hybrid baseline if relaxation helps OOD splits via per-step signal preservation.
- **Mechanism reasoning:** Lion's post-sign gradient norm scales with √D (~1000 for ~1M-param model); max_norm=0.5 rescales by 0.5/1000=5e-4 per step → effectively a secondary lr. Relaxing should preserve more gradient direction; risk is divergence at max_norm=2.0.
- **Status:** Assigned; awaiting training.

## 2026-05-13 20:50 — PR #2604 (ASSIGNED, fern): hybrid_kendall_lr push {1e-3, 2e-3} on merged hybrid baseline — test σ-spread ceiling

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/hybrid-kendall-lr-push-1e3-2e3`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** #2540 established a NEW β–σ coupling mechanism: higher β collapses σ-spread (β=0.3→0.475 / β=0.5→0.401 / β=1.0→0.304). The σ-spread axis is doing load-bearing work, and the merged `hybrid_kendall_lr=5e-4` may only be a partial harvest. Push lr ∈ {1e-3, 2e-3} (2× and 4× current) to test whether more per-channel differentiation compounds val/test.
- **Why this is high-value:** Single-CLI-flag, zero-code-change axis. The #2311 internal sweep already showed lr=3e-4→5e-4 was monotonic on spread (0.07→0.475), strongly suggesting more headroom upward. β–σ coupling discovery from #2540 confirms σ-spread is the lever to push. Compounds the merged baseline if won.
- **Mechanism reasoning:** AdamW lr on log_σ controls per-channel adaptation speed; at lr=5e-4 wd=0 the heads reach equilibrium at spread=0.475 by end of training; higher lr → wider spread (faster adaptation) → more channel differentiation → larger gains on `single_in_dist` test (the channel that gained −2.11% from #2311's spread restoration).
- **Status:** Assigned; awaiting training.

## 2026-05-13 20:45 — PR #2540 (CLOSED, fern): Huber β sweep {0.5, 1.0} on hybrid Lion+AdamW baseline — re-validate β optimum after σ-spread fix

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/huber-beta-sweep-on-hybrid-baseline`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** β=0.3 was tuned on pre-Lion / pre-RFF / pre-hybrid stack. With σ-spread now restored (0→0.475) per #2311, per-channel Kendall weights are differentiated and the effective loss gradient distribution has changed. Test β ∈ {0.5, 1.0} to see if β-optimum shifted.

### Result table (vs new hybrid baseline)

| Arm | β | val | test | Δval% | Δtest% | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline #2311 | 0.3 | 45.2181 | 38.7661 | — | — | — |
| Arm 1 `smmx6wqc` | 0.5 | 46.8203 | 39.3759 | +3.54% | +1.57% | regress |
| Arm 2 `7729inmc` | 1.0 | 49.7958 | 42.4415 | +10.12% | +9.48% | major regress |

**Verdict:** monotonic worsening on both val and test → **β=0.3 axis robust to hybrid optimizer change**. Decision rule (`val ≥ 45.76 → close`) fires for both arms.

### Banked findings (5)

1. **β–σ coupling mechanism (NEW)** — Higher β systematically collapses Kendall log_σ differentiation: spread β=0.3=0.475 → β=0.5=0.401 (−16%) → β=1.0=0.304 (−36%). The β knob is NOT orthogonal to σ-differentiation. Mechanism: as β↑, smooth-L1 residuals quadratically attenuate in |r|<β region; gradient magnitudes ∝ 1/β; cross-channel SNR in log_σ gradient signal shrinks → per-channel heads push toward uniform. **Directly motivates #2604 hybrid_kendall_lr push (test the other direction of the spread lever).**
2. **β=0.3 also maximally preserves σ-spread.** Not coincidence — β=0.3 win compounds with #2311's mechanism via σ-preservation, making β=0.3 doubly load-bearing.
3. **12th independent clip_fraction≈0.99 confirmation** — β=0.5 arm: 0.9949; β=1.0 arm: 0.9590. Clip-saturation findings now 12-strong; **directly motivates #2606 max_norm sweep.**
4. **Refuted grad-norm prediction (NEW methodology finding)** — PR predicted p99‖g‖ ordering β=1.0 > β=0.5 > β=0.3. Observed: β=0.5 (36.06) > β=1.0 (28.57). Smooth-L1 grad slope is 1/β in |r|<β region; bulk of residual mass at mid-late training lies in |r|<β → slope-1/β regime dominates → lower β → higher grad-norm. **grad-norm is NOT a valid proxy for "MSE-likeness" in this regime.**
5. **30-min timeout cap cut both arms at epoch 13/15.** SWA averaged 2 epochs. Apples-to-apples between arms unambiguous; vs 15-epoch baseline the gaps may slightly underestimate but the +1.60 val / +0.61 test margin for better arm (β=0.5) will not close.

### Closing rationale

β axis is closed; β=0.3 confirmed as robust optimum on hybrid stack with a NEW mechanism explanation (σ-spread coupling). Followups: σ-spread push (assigned to fern in #2604) and clip relaxation (assigned to thorfinn in #2606).

## 2026-05-13 20:15 — PR #2512 (CLOSED, thorfinn): Multi-scale RFF 8×σ=0.5 + 8×σ=0.1 on Lion stack (Tancik §5) — compose resolution + regularization

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/multiscale-rff-8sigma0p5-8sigma0p1`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** #2407 established σ=0.1 acts as regularizer (drives single_in_dist test −3.22%). Multi-scale RFF (Tancik 2020 §5) combines 8×σ=0.5 (resolution) + 8×σ=0.1 (regularizer) holding total channels at 16. Zero compute/VRAM increase.

### Result table (vs new hybrid baseline #2311)

| Metric | This run `6ojk8sut` | Baseline #2311 | Δ | % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p (primary) | 46.4211 | 45.2181 | +1.2030 | +2.66% |
| test_avg/mae_surf_p (paper) | 39.2320 | 38.7661 | +0.4659 | +1.20% |

**Verdict:** REGRESSION on both axes. 3/4 splits worse on val (cruise the only winner); 3/4 worse on test (cruise tied). Multi-scale RFF does NOT compose on hybrid stack.

### Mechanism revision (KEY FINDING)

The σ=0.1-alone gain on #2407 was on the **pre-#2311 collapsed-σ stack** (all 6 log_σ → −0.9037). In that regime, low-σ RFF acted as regularizer that helped `single_in_dist` test (−3.22%). With #2311's hybrid Kendall providing differentiated per-channel weighting (σ-spread=0.484 here, 0.475 in baseline) — which itself improved `single_in_dist` test by −2.11% — **the low-σ RFF regularizer becomes redundant and over-regularizing.**

`single_in_dist` test trajectory:
- 42.45 (collapsed-σ + σ=0.5 RFF, pre-#2311)
- 40.34 (hybrid-σ + σ=0.5 RFF, NEW baseline #2311, −2.11%)
- 41.39 (hybrid-σ + multi-scale RFF, this run, +2.59% vs new baseline)

σ=0.1 regularizer mechanism revision from #2407 was **conditional on σ-collapse providing no other per-channel signal.** Once #2311 fixed σ-collapse, the regularizer effect dissolves — adding more on top hurts.

### Banked findings (5)

1. **Multi-scale RFF and Kendall σ-differentiation share an information channel.** σ=0.1 RFF regularizer story was σ-collapse-conditional, not absolute. **Banked structural finding: #2311 substitutes for the per-channel regularization role low-σ RFF was filling.**
2. **σ axis exhausted: 10 distinct RFF σ configurations evaluated.** σ=0.5 wins on every stack since Lion was adopted. Confirms σ=0.5 as canonical.
3. **3rd–4th independent confirmation of clip_fraction = 1.000** (max_norm=0.5 + Lion + grad_norm_mean=19.22). Now 4 confirmations strong → **directly motivates #2606 max_norm sweep (thorfinn's own follow-up #3).**
4. **Multi-scale construction verified** (Tancik 2020 §5 implementation correct). Block 0 std 0.4684, block 1 std 0.1117 — matches expected sampling.
5. **Hybrid Kendall mechanism re-verified across third stack.** σ-spread 0.484 here vs baseline 0.475 — no Kendall drift from multi-scale change. Independent confirmation hybrid_kendall_lr=5e-4 is stable.

### Closing rationale

σ axis is closed. Decisively-tuned axes now: optimizer (Lion, #2168), Huber β (β=0.3, #2540 closes), RFF σ (σ=0.5, this PR closes), Kendall σ-collapse (hybrid_kendall_lr=5e-4, #2311). **Next axes: max_norm (thorfinn #2606 NEXT), hybrid_kendall_lr push (fern #2604 NEXT), architectural changes.**

## 2026-05-13 19:10 — PR #2311 (**MERGED** ⭐, fern): Hybrid Lion+AdamW for Kendall σ heads on σ=0.5 stack — σ-collapse fix + compound win

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/hybrid-adamw-for-kendall-sigma-on-lion`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** Lion's sign-of-EMA-gradient update collapses all 6 `log_σ` channels to −0.9037, making Kendall multi-task weighting ≡ uniform weighting. Route `log_σ` through a separate AdamW optimizer (lr=5e-4, wd=0) while keeping Lion for all model params. AdamW preserves gradient-magnitude signal on the σ heads, allowing per-channel differentiation while Lion drives the model.

### Result table

**W&B runs:** `3s60eja4` (original Arm 2), `objur0b9` (rebased confirmation), `9knvxnso` (Arm 1 lr=3e-4, miss).

### Per-split SWA (paper-facing test in bold)

| Split | val #2168 | val Hybrid | Δ val | test #2168 | test Hybrid | Δ test |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 48.774 | **46.967** | **−1.81** | 42.451 | **40.340** | **−2.11** |

| geom_camber_cruise | 29.111 | 29.496 | +0.38 | 23.445 | 23.712 | +0.27 |
| re_rand | 46.885 | **46.283** | **−0.60** | 38.156 | 38.231 | +0.08 |

Wins on 3/4 val and 3/4 test splits; cruise slight regression (+0.27 test, already strongest split). Load-bearing OOD splits (geom_camber_rc, single_in_dist) show largest absolute test gains — matching mechanism prediction.

### Key mechanism findings

1. **σ spread restored: 0.000 → 0.475** (6 distinct channels from near-uniform collapse). surf_ux/surf_uy weighted higher than vol channels → surface velocity re-emphasis drives `single_in_dist` and `geom_camber_rc` gains.
2. **Dose-response validated:** lr=3e-4 → spread=0.07, val=47.07 (miss); lr=5e-4 → spread=0.475, val=45.22 (winner). Linear response confirms mechanism causality.
3. **Rebase stability:** confirmation run `objur0b9` bit-for-bit identical to original (`3s60eja4`) → rebase didn't disturb the result.
4. **Open mechanism: mean drift.** `mean(log_σ)` drifted to −1.98 (vs AdamW-eq −1.40), inflating all eff_w ~3×. Partially offset by spread. #2500 alphonse tests mean-anchor fix.
5. **σ-collapse fix #1 of 3 confirmed and merged.** Fern's hybrid optimizer is now part of the merged codebase. Other two fixes (#2443 alphonse init, #2500 alphonse anchor-mean) remain banked/in-flight.

### New baseline (post-merge)

- **val:** 45.2181 (was 45.7648 — −1.20%)
- **test:** 38.7661 (was 39.6619 — −2.26%)
- **Merge threshold for all subsequent PRs:** val < 45.22, test < 38.77

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/multiscale-rff-8sigma0p5-8sigma0p1`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** #2407 established σ=0.1 acts primarily as a **regularizer** (drives in-distribution test win −3.22%, not OOD-geom), and σ=0.5 provides positional resolution (val baseline). Multi-scale RFF (Tancik 2020 §5) partitions B-matrix columns across multiple bandwidths in a single concatenated feature vector; 8 features at σ=0.5 + 8 features at σ=0.1 keeps total channels = 32 (zero compute/VRAM increase) while combining both mechanisms.
- **Why this is high-value:** Direct test of additivity between the two RFF mechanisms identified in #2407. Strong literature backing (Tancik 2020 §5 explicitly recommends multi-scale). One-line code change (modify `FourierCoordFeatures.__init__` to accept tuple-of-sigmas). Single-arm experiment, sharp decision rule on whether val + test composes.

### Result table

**W&B runs:** `hmic4qwn` (Arm 1), `93e9m26v` (Arm 2). Both 30.6 min wall, healthy training, peak ~44 GB / 96 GB.

### Per-split SWA (Arm 1 σ=0.1, paper-facing test in bold)

| Split | val σ=0.1 | val σ=0.5 | Δ% | test σ=0.1 | test σ=0.5 | Δ% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| re_rand | 47.002 | 46.885 | +0.25% | 38.640 | 38.156 | +1.27% |

**Critical finding:** σ=0.1's test gain is **driven by single_in_dist**, not OOD-geom. geom_camber_cruise *reverses* (+3.43% worse than σ=0.5). The original mechanism story "lower σ helps OOD-geom more" partially survives at rc (−3.59%, tied with σ=0.25's 52.557) but fails at cruise.

### Diagnostics

| Diagnostic | Arm 1 (σ=0.1) | Arm 2 (σ=0.25 s1) | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `fourier/rff_mean` | **0.441** | 0.385 | cos-dominated at low σ (near-degenerate) |
| `fourier/rff_std` | 0.553 | 0.593 | < theoretical 0.707 |
| `final/log_sigma_*` | **−0.9037** | **−0.9037** | Kendall collapse to clamp under Lion (10th + 11th confirmations) |
| `train/clip_fraction_mean` | **0.992** | **0.997** | **2nd independent confirmation of ≈0.99** (matches frieren #2363 0.99); BASELINE.md "~0.74" is stale |
| `best_epoch` (base) | 12 | 13 | both converged late |

### Banked findings (5)

1. **σ bracket bottomed out on val.** σ→smaller is dead on primary metric; σ=0.5 stays canonical.
2. **σ=0.25's test win was a seed-0 outlier.** Cross-seed mean test (39.72) ties σ=0.5 (39.66). Seed gap +1.42, well above val-gap noise ~0.86.
3. **σ=0.1 mechanism = regularizer, not OOD-prior.** Gain driver is single_in_dist (−3.22%), not OOD-geom; cruise REVERSES. Low-σ Fourier features → near-degenerate (rff_mean=0.44 cos-dominated) → smoother predictions. This is the kind of regularizer that should compose with high-σ resolution → motivates #2512 multi-scale RFF.
4. **2nd independent clip_fraction≈0.99 confirmation.** Under Lion+max_norm=0.5, the clipper saturates every step (99.2% / 99.7%). BASELINE.md "~0.74" note is from a different regime. Worth a future max_norm relaxation pass.
5. **σ axis exhaustion = pivot signal.** Five σ values tested (0.1, 0.25 ×2 seeds, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). σ=0.5 wins on val. Pivot to multi-scale composition (Tancik §5) or huber_beta sweep on RFF baseline (student's suggested follow-up, banked for later wave).

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/anchor-mean-log-sigma-on-sigma0p5`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** #2443 showed Lion+AdamW-eq-init preserves spread (0.000→0.478) and improves test (−0.40) but mean drifts ~0.6 nats more negative → all eff_w inflate 3× → val regresses +0.61. An L2 anchor loss `λ * (mean(log_σ) − (−1.4))²` should pin the mean at AdamW-equilibrium while letting per-channel Kendall gradient drive spread freely. Lion sees the gradient sign — anchor flips the average direction when mean drifts below target. **2-arm sweep λ ∈ {1, 5}** brackets the anchor strength.
- **Why this is high-value:** Targets the open mean-drift mechanism directly identified in #2443. Single new loss term + 1 hyperparameter. Orthogonal to all in-flight work (no other PR touches Kendall loss formulation). If wins, compounds with fern's #2311 (which fixes spread via optimizer split; this fixes mean via loss term — independent mechanisms).

**Spread NEVER collapsed.** Grew from 0.150 (init) → 0.478 (final). Per-channel Kendall gradient sign is sufficient to maintain differentiation under Lion. The strong-form claim "Lion's sign-update FORCES collapse" is REFUTED.

| Hybrid Lion+AdamW (fern #2311 PENDING) | 0.81 | 45.22 | 38.77 | 2-optimizer plumbing |

Init alone gets us 3× more spread than AdamW equilibrium and ~60% of fern's hybrid mechanism, at zero engineering cost.

**Why val regressed:** mean drifted from −1.394 to −1.985 over 13 epochs (~0.045/epoch under Lion's sign-update). All effective weights grew 3× (e.g., surf_uy eff_w 7→46). The model over-emphasized Kendall regularization globally while differentiation locally was maintained. The val/test divergence (val +0.61, test −0.40) is consistent with Kendall over-weighting acting as an OOD regularizer — slight in-distribution degradation, real OOD test gain.

**Banked findings (5):**

1. **Init pattern alone PREVENTS Lion's σ-collapse** — strong-form refutation of previously-banked "sign-update is the entire driver of collapse". Per-channel Kendall gradient sign is sufficient signal given a non-degenerate starting point.
2. **Three-tier σ-spread ordering identified** (baseline < AdamW < init-only < hybrid).
3. **Test-set improvement (−0.40 MAE) without val improvement** — first Wave-12 finding with val/test divergence in this direction. Connects to #2390 askeladd's wd-not-shrinkage finding (Lion has multiple knobs that act through OOD-regularization channels).
4. **Mean drift is the OPEN issue** — Lion's sign-update still drifts mean ~0.6 nats more negative. This is the mechanism behind the val regression. **#2500 anchor-mean fix tests this directly.**
5. **Compounds orthogonally with fern's #2311 hybrid** — fern fixes spread via optimizer; init fixes spread via starting point; anchor (#2500) fixes mean via loss term. All three can stack.

**Suggested follow-ups:**
- alphonse's own #2 (anchor-mean loss) → **#2500 assigned**.
- Compound test (init + hybrid + anchor) — pending fern's #2311 confirmation rerun and #2500 result.
- Per-split test analysis — clamping mean(log_σ) ≥ −1.6 might preserve val while keeping OOD test gain. Subsumed by #2500's λ=5 arm (stronger anchor).

## 2026-05-13 17:30 — PR #2484 (ASSIGNED, frieren): Skip SWALR — let cosine continue through SWA window; direct test of SWALR-overrides-cosine mental model

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-frieren/skip-swalr-cosine-through-swa-window`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-frieren
- **Hypothesis:** SWALR overrides cosine immediately at swa_start_epoch (3rd-confirmed mechanism). Skipping SWALR lets cosine continue through SWA window — SWA averages cosine-tail weights (lower LR, more tightly clustered around local optimum) instead of SWALR-floor weights (constant 6e-5). The original SWA paper's "constant LR for diversity" recommendation may not apply at our 13-epoch budget where cosine LR at epoch 13 = 1.95e-5 is still moving weights meaningfully under Lion's sign-update.
- **Why this is high-value:** Directly tests the falsifiable alternative to the SWALR-overrides-cosine mental model that has misled #2187/#2285/#2342/#2429. Orthogonal to #2463 (swa_lr value) and #2481 (anneal_epochs) — both still use SWALR.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/swa-anneal-epochs-1-on-sigma0p5`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-edward
- **Hypothesis:** SWALR with anneal_epochs=2 wastes 1 epoch of SWA averaging on weights at mid-ramp LRs (1.04e-4 → 8.18e-5 → 6e-5). Cutting cooldown to 1 epoch gets the base model to swa_lr 1 epoch earlier; SWA window averages 3 epochs of weights at the swa_lr=6e-5 floor instead of 1 mid-ramp + 2 floor. Lion step magnitude at LR=8.18e-5 is ~36% larger than at 6e-5 → noisier ensemble.
- **Why this is high-value:** Directly motivated by edward's own #2429 Diagnostic 3. Single-line code change. Orthogonal to all in-flight work (changes ramp speed, not floor value).

Largest regression on `single_in_dist` (+4.4) — the easiest split — consistent with under-training rather than over-fitting.

### Commentary and conclusions

**Three mechanism predictions failed:**

1. **Lion has NO chaotic init phase.** Baseline epoch-1 val=189.70 at lr=3e-4 is NOT a chaotic-init signature — it's just where Lion's sign(EMA(grad)) lands after one epoch. Warmup at lr=1e-4 made epoch-1 *worse* (390.91), since sign-update direction is identical and magnitude shrinks.
2. **clip_fraction is invariant to lr schedule.** Epochs 1-3 at lr ∈ {1e-4, 2e-4, 3e-4} all showed clip_fraction ≈ 99-100%. Clipping happens on raw ‖g‖ pre-optimizer-scaling — gradient distribution is set by (model + data + loss), not by hyperparameter schedule. **The persistent-clipping signature CANNOT be fixed by warmup/lr.**
3. **Budget cost > smoothing benefit.** By epoch 9 warmup run was AHEAD (val 67.17 vs 78.74), but 30-min budget cut at epoch 13 before SWA could convert. Warmup spends 3 of 13 effective epochs at sub-lr → no budget left to amortize.

**Banked findings (6):**

1. **Lion does NOT have a chaotic init phase like Adam** — Adam→Lion mental model transfer for warmup is REFUTED. Don't assume Adam-paper recommendations transfer just because both are momentum-based.
2. **clip_fraction is invariant to lr schedule** — gradient distribution is a property of (model + data + loss), not hyperparameters. Future clip-related experiments must manipulate `max_norm` or upstream loss/architecture, NOT lr.
3. **Warmup smooths the trajectory (no epoch-7 regression) but smoothing alone isn't enough** for SWA-quality endpoint under the 30-min budget cap.
4. **Budget-binding principle for lr-schedule manipulations** — at SENPAI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30 → ~13 effective epochs, ANY lr modification costing >1 epoch of full-lr training will struggle to recover. Applies to: warmup, longer T_max, EMA warm-up.
5. **9th independent σ-collapse confirmation** — log_σ trajectory identical to baseline through warmup phase. σ-collapse invariant to lr schedule (in addition to grad-clip, optimizer, T_max).
6. **clip_fraction definition discrepancy flagged** — student observed 99-100% clip_fraction while BASELINE.md cites 74% from #2063 `5hp3gid7`. Worth a future diagnostic PR — either definition mismatch or gradient norms have drifted across the merge series. Connects to #2270 alphonse pre-clip diagnostics gap.

**Axis fully closed.** No follow-up arms recommended for the warmup direction. Student reassigned to **#2484 skip-SWALR experiment** — direct test of SWALR-overrides-cosine mental model, building on the diagnostic skill demonstrated here.

| re_rand | 46.885 | 47.843 | +0.96 |

### Commentary and conclusions

**The hypothesis "Lion plateau onset is earlier than AdamW" was wrong for this 13-epoch budget.** Edward's Diagnostic 2 shows train/loss dropping 0.57 (Arm 1) and 1.06 (Arm 2) units AFTER SWA start — clear non-plateau. Plateau onset is ≥ epoch 12. SWA windows of 4-6 epochs average actively-descending weights.

Edward's Diagnostic 3 also surfaces the **3rd independent confirmation** that SWALR overrides cosine immediately at swa_start_epoch — at frac=0.6 the model trains at LR ≤ 1.04e-4 for epochs 9-13 (vs cosine which would have continued descending to ~3e-5 by epoch 13).

**Banked findings (6):**

1. **Lion's plateau onset on this 13-epoch budget is ≥ epoch 12, NOT 7-9.** The "Lion converges faster than AdamW so plateau starts earlier" mental model fails at timeout-capped budgets.
2. **3rd independent SWALR-overrides-cosine confirmation** — tanjiro #2342 originally surfaced the mechanism; edward #2429's Diagnostic 3 confirms. The "SWA averages cosine eta_min plateau" mental model behind #2187, #2285, #2342, and #2429 is mechanically wrong.
3. **swa_start_frac<0.75 compounds two regressions:** pre-plateau averaging AND earlier base-model LR cut. Multiplicative not additive cost.
4. **`geom_camber_rc` is the dominant error contributor (~2× the other splits) on the σ=0.5 Lion stack.** Now the load-bearing OOD split for all future architecture/data work.
5. **8th independent σ-collapse confirmation** — log_σ ≈ −0.88 to −0.91, invariant to SWA schedule.
6. **effective_weight diagnostic** is a clean addition to σ-collapse confirmation reporting (= exp(−2·log_σ)).

**Suggested follow-ups (from edward):**
- Follow-up #2 (raise swa_lr → cosine-final) is in flight as tanjiro #2463.
- **Follow-up #3 (anneal_epochs=1)** is the natural next step — orthogonal to all in-flight; edward reassigned to **#2481** to run it.
- Opposite-direction bracket (frac=0.85) banked as future direction.

### Commentary and conclusions

**Mechanism validated, decision-tree forces rebase.** Arm C (wd=3e-3) wins on σ=1.0 stack — monotonic, no V-shape in tested range. Largest gain concentrated on `geom_camber_rc` (−1.49 val absolute on the bottleneck split). Per σ=0.5 merge rule, val ∈ [45.76, 47.64] → directional win on σ=1.0, **send back to test composition with σ=0.5**.

**Banked findings (4):**

1. **wd is directionally correct on this stack (Chen 2023 confirmed)** — Lion wants ≥1e-3 wd; 3e-3 is the best tested point. No V-shape across {1e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3}.
2. **wd mechanism is NOT weight shrinkage.** param_norm differs <0.2% between arms A and C despite 30× wd ratio. Lion's sign-step (`±lr`) overwhelms wd's pull-toward-zero on this lr/timescale; wd is acting through some other channel — probably small per-coord corrections to the sign direction that accumulate into better implicit regularization on OOD-modulated geometries.
3. **6th independent confirmation of Lion+Kendall σ-collapse.** All 6 log_σ → exactly −0.903749 in every arm, identical drift trajectory to 6 decimal places. wd cannot affect this because log_σ params live in the no-wd group. **wd CANNOT rescue the σ axis — only #2311 fern hybrid optim or #2443 alphonse init can.**
4. **`train/param_norm` + `train/param_rms` is a clean diagnostic** — student added it; will travel with the rebase. Cheap (~ms), broadly useful for any future wd/regularization PR.

### Action taken: rebase + 2-arm sweep on σ=0.5 {3e-3, 1e-2}

- Direct composition test (wd=3e-3 on σ=0.5)
- Push direction further (wd=1e-2) — student's suggested follow-up #2 redirected to σ=0.5 not σ=1.0 because of #2168 σ × optimizer × wd non-monotonicity finding
- If Arm 1 beats 45.76 → MERGE. If Arm 2 also wins → ceiling not found, follow-up upward. If Arm 2 regresses vs Arm 1 → ceiling at 3e-3, banked.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/swa-lr-sweep-on-sigma0p5`
- **Hypothesis:** swa_lr = cfg.lr * 0.2 = 6e-5 (hardcoded) is matched only by coincidence to where cosine lands at swa_start_frac=0.75. Bidirectional sweep brackets the SWA averaging-lr level — Arm A (0.05x) ramps DOWN from cosine_lr=5.9e-5 to 1.5e-5 then plateaus deep; Arm B (0.5x) ramps UP from cosine_lr to 1.5e-4 then plateaus moderate.
- **Why now:** Directly tests tanjiro's #2342 banked finding (SWALR ramp direction dominates SWA averaging quality). Composes with edward's #2429 (frac sweep) on the orthogonal axis: width × level. Mechanism-orthogonal to all other Wave 12 PRs.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/t-max-10-cosine-on-lion`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro
- **Hypothesis:** Faster cosine annealing (T_max ∈ {10, 12} vs MAX_EPOCHS=15) places lr in eta_min plateau earlier; SWA window then averages 3-5 epochs of low lr instead of 2.

Vs σ=0.5 merged baseline (45.76 val): Arm A +13.4%, Arm B +9.8% — both far outside any merge-zone.

### Commentary and conclusions

**Hypothesis cleanly refuted with a mechanistically definitive autopsy.** tanjiro's lr-trace diagnostic shows SWALR overrides cosine the instant `epoch >= swa_start_epoch` and ramps UPWARD to `swa_lr = cfg.lr * 0.2 = 6e-5`. There is NO "cosine eta_min plateau" available to SWA under the current configuration — SWALR hijacks the schedule. T_max compression makes things WORSE because (a) cuts useful cosine annealing time before SWA hijacks, (b) creates a larger gap that SWALR must ramp across.

### Banked findings (6) — gold for the whole SWA research line

1. **SWALR overrides cosine immediately at swa_start_epoch.** The mental model behind #2187, #2285, this PR, and partially edward's #2429 (SWA averages cosine eta_min plateau) is **mechanically wrong**.
2. **The closer T_max is to MAX_EPOCHS, the less damage done** — T_max compression is always harmful. The baseline T_max=15 is the least-damaged configuration. **Direction of this PR's hypothesis was exactly inverted.**
3. **swa_lr = cfg.lr * 0.2 = 6e-5 is hardcoded at train.py:719** — but cosine at swa_start_frac=0.75 of T_max=15 lands at lr ≈ 5.9e-5. **Current baseline is matched by coincidence**, not by design. Future SWA experiments that change T_max OR swa_start_frac without matching swa_lr will recreate the SWALR-override artifact.
4. **Default `eta_min=0` in CosineAnnealingLR** is moot under current SWA configuration (SWALR hijacks before cosine can reach 0); relevant only for skip-SWALR follow-ups.
5. **For T_max smaller than MAX_EPOCHS, SWALR upward ramp dominates averaging quality.** T_max=10 wastes 3 SWA epochs on SWALR ramping from 1.5e-5 → 6e-5; T_max=12 wastes 2-3. SWA averages the *trajectory of weights during the ramp*, not the well-trained low-lr weights.
6. **Sharpened prediction for edward's #2429 swa_start_frac sweep (still in flight):** going EARLIER (frac ∈ {0.5, 0.6}) gives cosine ≈ 1.5e-4 at swa_start, SWALR ramps DOWNWARD to swa_lr=6e-5, then plateaus 4-6 epochs at the same lr. That's the right direction — earlier should beat later (opposite of this PR's direction). #2429 result will close out either way.

### Suggested follow-ups (direct from tanjiro's analysis)

1. **Lower `swa_lr` to match cosine at swa_start** — `swa_lr = cfg.lr * 0.05 = 1.5e-5` so SWALR ramps DOWN not UP. **ASSIGNED as #2463 (this loop).**
2. Skip SWALR entirely — let cosine continue through SWA window.
3. Delay SWA start to `MAX_EPOCHS - 2 = 13`.

T_max < MAX_EPOCHS axis CLOSED. SWALR-direction axis OPENED via #2463.

## 2026-05-13 16:40 — PR #2443 (ASSIGNED, alphonse): Kendall log_σ init at AdamW-equilibrium on σ=0.5 Lion — structural alt to hybrid optimizer

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/kendall-log-sigma-init-at-adamw-equilibrium`
- **Hypothesis:** Lion+Kendall σ-collapse is sign-update pathology of *zero-init symmetry* — initialize log_σ at AdamW-equilibrium pattern (−1.34 to −1.49 with surface-velocity emphasis) so channels start at different gradient regimes. Lion's sign-update should preserve relative ordering through training.
- **Mechanism:** Kendall ∂L/∂log_σ_c = −2·exp(−2·log_σ_c)·mse_c + 1 — gradient sign changes per-channel based on whether loss-weight is over/under-tuned. If channels start differentiated, sign sequences diverge → spread preserved.
- **Why now:** #2270 just refuted max_norm relaxation but reconfirmed AdamW-equilibrium log_σ pattern (within 0.05 of #1906 values) — high-confidence target init values. Single-arm experiment, 1-line code change. Structural alternative to fern's #2311 hybrid optimizer at zero engineering cost.
- **Predicted:** If σ-collapse is init-symmetry-driven, log_σ spread > 0.3 at end of training AND val improves over baseline by 0.5-2.0 via surface-velocity upweighting. If sign-update collapse is inherent regardless of init, log_σ drift back together within 5 epochs → mechanism refuted.

### Commentary and conclusions

Hypothesis **refuted by clip_fraction diagnostic**. clip_fraction stays ≥0.9949 even at max_norm=1.0 (2× original) — gradients exceed the cap on >99.4% of steps regardless. The "relaxation" never actually unclamped the optimizer; it just rescaled the gradient direction by a slightly larger constant. Both arms in noise band [66.66, 67.52]. Best arm (0.75) +0.20 val over baseline, within seed noise.

**Banked findings (5):**

1. **clip_fraction stays ≥0.995 even at max_norm=2× baseline.** Combined with #2347's no-clip arm (regressed +9% on Lion+β=0.3) and max_norm=2.0 arm (flat), this brackets clip-relaxation top-to-bottom on both AdamW and Lion stacks. **Axis fully closed.**
2. **β=0.3-Huber's near-linear regime means pre-clip grad norms are systematically large.** Future grad-clip work should log pre-clip `train/grad_norm` p50/p90/p99 first so we know which max_norm values would actually unclamp.
3. **Larger effective step within binding-clip regime degrades SWA quality (mild signal).** Arm 2 (1.0) was 0.48 val / 0.32 test *worse* than arm 1 (0.75) — *opposite* of hypothesis direction. Echoes SWA-window-quality findings from #2354 and #2347.
4. **Kendall log_σ values under AdamW+β=0.3+max_norm relaxation converged to AdamW-equilibrium pattern** (surf_p=−1.34, surf_ux=−1.49, surf_uy=−1.47, vol_p=−1.38, vol_ux=−1.34, vol_uy=−1.35). Within 0.05 of #1906. **High-confidence target init for #2443 alphonse Kendall init experiment.**
5. **AdamW+β=0.3 stack unreachable from current Lion baseline** — best arm 66.86 vs Lion baseline 45.76 — Lion is the dominant lever (~30% better at every config). All future grad-clip work must be on Lion stack.

Excellent diagnostic discipline by alphonse — clip_fraction analysis was the hypothesis-killer and surfaces info that shapes future grad-clip and Kendall-init work.

## 2026-05-13 16:30 — PR #2378 (CLOSED, nezuko): Lion + slice_num=96 (geometric-token bump) on β=0.3+RFF+Kendall — clean regression, conflation of capacity axes

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/lion-slice-num-96-on-beta0p3`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-nezuko
- **Hypothesis:** slice_num=96 (vs 64 default) adds compute-frugal capacity by giving Transolver more geometric tokens to attend over. Target the geom_camber_rc bottleneck (58.29 val at σ=0.5).

### Result table

| Arm | slice_num | step time | params (added) | SWA val | Δ vs #2168 baseline | SWA test | Δ vs test | W&B |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Baseline #2168 | 64 | 138s | (baseline) | 45.7648 | — | 39.6619 | — | `7f6pqafs` |
| **slice_num=96** | 96 | 161s (+16%) | +5K (NOT +310K) | **49.95** | **+4.19 (+9.16%)** | **44.60** | **+4.94 (+12.46%)** | (see PR) |

### Commentary and conclusions

**Hypothesis refuted** — slice_num=96 regressed val by +4.19 and test by +4.94 vs σ=0.5 baseline. Critical autopsy finding: the PR conflated `n_hidden` with `dim_head`. slice_num only sizes `in_project_slice = nn.Linear(dim_head=32, slice_num)` — at slice_num=96, this adds only **5K params** (linear in `dim_head × slice_num`, dominated by dim_head=32), not 310K as `n_hidden × slice_num` would suggest.

**Banked findings (5):**

1. **slice_num at fixed n_head/dim_head is NOT a capacity axis** — only adds ~5K params total. Future capacity bumps on this architecture must touch `n_hidden`, `n_layers`, or `n_head` (the n_head sweep is now assigned to nezuko as #2442).
2. **slice_num=96 hurts geom_camber_rc specifically** — +5.65 val / +4.94 test regression on the targeted bottleneck. Adding token slots without head capacity is *harmful* — likely diluting the attention map across slots without meaningful geometric content.
3. **Step time scales linearly in slice_num** — 161s vs 138s (~16% slower) as predicted. slice_num is a real compute axis — the wrong axis to push.
4. **σ-collapse robust to slice_num** — 5th independent confirmation. All 6 log_σ → identical −0.8832. Reinforces structural mechanism: invariant to width (#2354), grad-clip (#2347), RFF σ (#2168), slice_num.
5. **SWA window collapsed to 1 epoch under slice_num=96** — same failure mode as #2354 width bump. Slower step time pushes timeout into base-epoch territory. edward's #2429 directly addresses this.

slice_num axis CLOSED at fixed n_head/dim_head. Next capacity axis: head granularity (assigned to nezuko as #2442).

## 2026-05-13 16:00 — PR #2347 (CLOSED): Drop/relax grad-clip on Lion (max_norm ∈ {0.0, 2.0}) — clean refutation, max_norm=0.5 is the right setting

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/drop-grad-clip-on-lion`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-edward
- **Hypothesis:** Lion's sign-update naturally bounds per-step weight changes; external grad-clip at max_norm=0.5 (clip_fraction=74%) is redundant or counterproductive. Predict val improves −0.5 to −2.0 by removing the clip.

### Result table (σ=1.0 stack)

| Arm | max_norm | clip_frac | val_avg | Δ vs #2063 | test_avg | Δ vs #2063 | W&B |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Baseline #2063 | 0.5 | 0.74 | 47.6416 | — | 40.5651 | — | `5hp3gid7` |
| **Arm A** (no clip) | 0.0 | n/a | **51.9515** | **+4.31 (+9.04%)** | 44.7157 | +4.15 (+10.23%) | `4kkcfwk2` |
| **Arm B** (relaxed) | 2.0 | 0.41 | 47.9299 | +0.29 (+0.62%) | 40.6789 | +0.11 (+0.28%) | `v505h4fp` |

### Commentary and conclusions

Hypothesis **clearly refuted**. The 74% clip-firing rate at max_norm=0.5 is NOT over-constraining — it's gentle normalization of a gradient distribution clustered around 0.5-2.5. Removing the clip entirely (Arm A) regresses by 9% on val because Lion's `update = sign(EMA(grad))` does NOT smooth out 17× gradient spikes; the magnitude bias survives the EMA and flips signs on borderline coordinates for many subsequent steps. Relaxing to max_norm=2.0 (Arm B) drops clip rate to 41% but produces no improvement — the typical gradient is right at the boundary, so the relaxation is empirically meaningless.

vs σ=0.5 baseline (#2168) gaps are 2.16 (Arm B) and 6.19 (Arm A) — both outside the rebase-to-test range. Axis closed.

### Banked findings

1. **max_norm=0.5 is the right setting under Lion** on this stack — gradient distribution clusters near the boundary, clip is gentle normalization not over-constraining.
2. **Lion's sign-update does NOT make grad-clip redundant** — sign(EMA) doesn't smooth out outlier spikes; magnitude bias survives EMA and propagates sign perturbations for many steps. Refutes common Lion-paper intuition. **Implication for paper:** Lion+RFF+Kendall on irregular-mesh CFD needs explicit grad-clipping despite Lion's intrinsic update bound.
3. **σ-collapse robust across max_norm ∈ {0.0, 0.5, 2.0}** — fourth independent confirmation (after #2063, #2354, #2168). All 6 log_σ converge to identical −0.9037 regardless of grad-clip strength. Lion+Kendall mechanical equivalence is fully insensitive to gradient-magnitude regulation.
4. **clip_fraction is a misleading "tightness" signal** — 74% at max_norm=0.5 sounds aggressive but actually means "most gradients are within ~2× of the cap." Relaxing to max_norm=2.0 drops clip_frac to 41% (NOT to <10% as predicted) because gradients cluster at 2.0-2.5.

Grad-clip-on-Lion axis CLOSED. Edward suggested asymmetric/per-group clipping as low-confidence follow-ups; not pursuing.

## 2026-05-13 16:00 — PR #2429 (ASSIGNED, edward): SWA start_frac sweep {0.5, 0.6} on σ=0.5 baseline

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/swa-start-frac-sweep-on-sigma0p5`
- **Hypothesis:** SWA-window starvation (currently averages only 2-3 epochs at 30-min timeout) is a key open bottleneck. Under Lion's faster convergence, loss plateau likely starts earlier than under AdamW — so earlier `swa_start_frac` could give 2-7× wider averaging window without picking up high-loss epochs.
- **Predicted:** Arm 1 (frac=0.6, conservative) likely safer; Arm 2 (frac=0.5, aggressive) brackets to find if plateau onset is mid-cosine.
- **Mechanism orthogonality:** Independent of all in-flight axes (RFF σ knob, hybrid σ optimizer, capacity, optimizer fine-tuning). tanjiro #2342 changes cosine T_max (schedule shape); this changes when averaging starts — different lever.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/hybrid-adamw-for-kendall-sigma-on-lion`

- **Hypothesis:** Lion's sign-update collapses all 6 Kendall log_σ to identical −0.904 (banked from #2063). Split parameters into Lion (model) + AdamW (log_σ) groups; AdamW preserves gradient magnitude needed for per-channel σ differentiation.

| vol_uy | −0.904 | — | −1.916 | 23.07 |

**Spread: 0.81 log-units** (vs 0 for Lion+Kendall). Mechanism prediction fully validated.

### Commentary and conclusions

**Mechanism win confirmed; hyperparameter overshoot caused test regression.**

The σ-channel collapse fix worked structurally — Lion's sign-update applied only to model params (update_norm = √754519 confirmed unchanged), while AdamW on the 6 log_σ scalars restored per-channel gradient-magnitude information. Surface-velocity channels (surf_ux/surf_uy) ended up emphasized 5× more than vol_ux — consistent with AdamW+Kendall #1906's surf_p-heavy weighting, but on different channels (surface velocity here vs surface pressure in #1906).

**The val win is real but small (−0.30 on σ=1.0 stack), and test slightly regressed (+0.39).** Root cause: AdamW lr=1e-3 drove log_σ to −1.8 to −2.6 by epoch 13, well past AdamW+Kendall #1906's equilibrium of ≈ −1.41 (descent rate 0.13/epoch, still descending linearly). Surface-velocity over-emphasis (eff. weight 92×, 74×) helps in-distribution val splits where surface is the cleanest signal but hurts OOD test where balanced channels matter.

**Decision:** Send back for (1) rebase to current σ=0.5 baseline (val ∈ [45.76, 47.64] zone → directional win on σ=1.0 only) and (2) lr sweep on hybrid_kendall_lr ∈ {3e-4, 5e-4} to fix overshoot. Predicted Arm 2 (5e-4) should reach near-#1906 equilibrium by epoch 13.

### Banked findings

1. **Hybrid Lion(model) + AdamW(log_σ) restores per-channel σ differentiation cleanly** — 0.81 log-unit spread reached in 13 epochs at AdamW lr=1e-3, with surface-velocity channels weighted ~5× more than volume channels. This is the structural fix for the Lion+Kendall σ-collapse banked from #2063/#2354/#2168. **Implication for paper:** the σ-collapse can be resolved with a 1-line code change (parameter group split) preserving Lion's main optimization benefits.
2. **AdamW lr=1e-3 overshoots on a 13-epoch run** — final log_σ ≈ −2.15 (mean) vs AdamW+Kendall #1906 equilibrium ≈ −1.41. Linear-descent dynamics suggest lr=5e-4 should hit equilibrium by epoch 13.
3. **Surface-velocity over-emphasis hurts OOD test** — when log_σ overshoots, effective weight on surf_ux/surf_uy reaches 92×/74× (vs vol_ux 18×). In-distribution val improves; OOD geometry test regresses. The right balance is closer to #1906's pattern (surface 5× volume, not 5×).

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/fourier-sigma-refine`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** σ→gain curve was monotonic in pre-Lion era (σ=2 worst → σ=1 mid → σ=0.5 best on RFF-only). Test whether σ=0.5 also wins on the current Lion+β=0.3+RFF+Kendall baseline.

### Result table

| Arm | Stack | val_avg | test_avg | W&B | Status |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | AdamW + β=0.3 + RFF σ=0.5 + Kendall | 67.1077 | 58.6090 | `nkfc2ozg` | Regresses vs AdamW+β=0.3+σ=1.0 (#1757: 66.66) |

| **avg** | **45.765** | **−3.94%** | **39.662** | **−2.23%** |

### Commentary and conclusions

Merged Arm 2 (σ=0.5) as new baseline — wins primary `swa_val_avg` ranking metric (45.7648 vs 47.6416), and student tagged it as `primary_metric` in the SENPAI-RESULT. Arm 3 (σ=0.25) wins paper-facing test by an additional −0.65 but loses val by 0.24 (within ~0.27σ of inter-seed noise ~0.86) — sent thorfinn back with σ=0.1 confirmation + σ=0.25 seed-1 replicate (PR #2407) to settle the val-vs-test trade-off.

### Banked findings

1. **Optimizer × σ × β=0.3 interaction is non-monotonic.** σ↓ wins under Lion+β=0.3 (−1.88 val) and AdamW+RFF-only (#2082 era, −0.47 val) but LOSES under AdamW+β=0.3 (Arm 1: +0.45 val vs σ=1.0 reference). AdamW's per-coord adaptive LR cancels the σ↓ benefit at β=0.3; Lion's sign-update restores compounding. **Mechanism implication:** any future σ-modifying experiment must check optimizer × loss-shape interaction.
2. **Lion+Kendall σ-collapse is robust to RFF bandwidth.** All 6 log_σ channels converge to identical −0.9037 at both σ=0.25 and σ=0.5 (matches #2063 σ=1.0 collapse). The Lion+Kendall mechanical equivalence to uniform-channel-weight is structural — fully invariant to input-encoding choices. Confirms #2311 (fern hybrid Lion+AdamW) is the right fix for σ differentiation; width/RFF approaches cannot help.
3. **Lower-σ Fourier = stronger OOD-geometry prior on this dataset.** Test_geom_camber_rc: σ=1.0 → 55.252, σ=0.5 → 54.596 (−1.19%), σ=0.25 → 52.557 (**−4.88%**). Test_geom_camber_cruise: σ=1.0 → 24.413, σ=0.25 → **22.922 (−6.11%)**. Mechanism: very-low-frequency Fourier coords act as a global geometric smoothness prior over camber shapes outside the training distribution. The test curve hasn't bottomed out at σ=0.25 — direct motivation for #2407 σ=0.1 probe.
4. **Three independent confirmations of σ-collapse mechanism** now banked (askeladd #2297, nezuko #2354, thorfinn #2168). Structural finding fully consolidated.

Baseline shifted from val 47.64 / test 40.57 (σ=1.0) to val 45.76 / test 39.66 (σ=0.5) mid-wave. All 7 currently-running Lion-stack PRs (#2390 askeladd, #2378 nezuko, #2363 frieren, #2347 edward, #2342 tanjiro, #2311 fern, #2270 alphonse) notified with the new threshold (val < 45.76 = merge; [45.76, 47.64] = directional win on σ=1.0 stack, needs rebase to test σ=0.5 composition; ≥ 47.64 = regression).

Triage decision for these runs: do NOT kill mid-run. The σ knob is mechanistically independent of most in-flight axes (warmup, T_max, grad-clip relaxation, slice_num, wd), so compounding is likely. Re-evaluate each on landing.

### Discovery: pre-existing bugs surfaced by this PR

1. **Constructor inconsistency in `Transolver`:** the `unified_pos=True` branch used `ref**3 = 512` (3D-Transolver copy) but the `forward` pass never built the encoding, so the flag alone crashed (`mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (200x24 and 534x256)`). Student fixed `train.py` with: (a) switch to `ref**2 = 64` for our 2D problem; (b) build per-mesh min-max-normalized distance encoding in `forward`; (c) plumb `mask` from train/eval call sites into the model dict.
2. **`data/scoring.py` NaN propagation:** `test_geom_camber_cruise/000020.pt` has NaN in the `p` channel of `y` (corrupt preprocessing artifact). `accumulate_batch` filters NaN-GT samples from the node count but `0 * nan = nan` still propagates through the err-sum, yielding a NaN channel total. This affects **every PR this round** that runs end-of-run test evaluation on `test_geom_camber_cruise`. Fix is a one-line `nan_to_num` on err before `* mask`.

### Decision

- **Sent back to student** for (a) the one-line `data/scoring.py` fix (authorized as an infra bug fix), (b) re-run at `--epochs=15` (val curve still descending at epoch 10 + we want to use more of the 30-min wall-clock budget for the cosine anneal), (c) same `unified_pos=True, ref=8` config so we get a clean `test_avg/mae_surf_p` without confounding hypothesis variables.
- Not merged: NaN test metric violates the paper-facing contract per `program.md`.
- Not closed: result is informative (val 147.65 is the first reference point, the val curve looks healthy, and the implementation is the right corrective shape for the broken constructor). The merge-eligible re-run inherits the same unified-pos code.

### Analysis

- **Val curve:** `val_avg/mae_surf_p` over 10 epochs went 261 → 222 → 214 → 179 → 190 → 172 → 168 → 151 → 156 → 148. Not strictly monotonic (epoch 4→5 spike +10.7, epoch 8→9 spike +4.8) but clearly trending down. Final epoch was the best, so undertrained.
- **OOD vs ID:** within-run, `val_geom_camber_cruise` (OOD) has the lowest absolute surf p MAE, but that's largely a function of the smaller pressure scale of the cruise domain (avg per-sample y std ~164 vs. ~458 for raceCar single, per `program.md`). Cannot read the OOD-improvement signal directly without a non-unified-pos baseline to compare against.
- **Implication for other wave-1 PRs:** the scoring NaN bug will hit every PR's `test_avg/mae_surf_p` unless they pull tanjiro's fix. Once tanjiro's re-run lands and merges, the other 7 PRs will need to rebase + rerun for clean test metrics. Plan to send each back individually after they post initial results.

- **Sent back to student** for (a) one-line `data/scoring.py` NaN-safe fix (authorized as infra bug fix, in parallel with PR #1454's identical fix), (b) re-run at `--epochs=15` since val was still descending steeply at epoch 10 (117→111 in the last 2 epochs), (c) keep Smooth-L1 β=1.0 isolated.
- If clean rerun lands, this is the wave-1 winner.

### Analysis

- **Hypothesis confirmed pattern-wise:** the two splits predicted to benefit most from outlier capping (`val_re_rand`, `val_geom_camber_cruise`) are the two lowest absolute MAEs. The two non-high-Re-dominated splits (`val_single_in_dist`, `val_geom_camber_rc`) are the highest.
- **vs. tanjiro PR #1454:** 111.06 (frieren) vs. 147.65 (tanjiro) on val_avg/mae_surf_p, ~25% lower. Frieren wins on a loss-function change, tanjiro on a positional encoding change. These are orthogonal — they could stack in wave 2.
- **β sweep is a natural follow-up:** β=1.0 was a guess; values in {0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0} could be tested. Lower β acts more like L1 (more aggressive outlier capping); higher β acts more like MSE.

## 2026-05-12 19:16 — PR #1455: Batch=8, lr=7.1e-4 (sqrt(2)-scaled)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/batch-8-lr-up`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** Doubling batch size 4→8 with sqrt-scaled lr (5e-4→7.1e-4) reduces gradient noise and improves convergence at no VRAM cost. Predicted −2 to −6% on val_avg/mae_surf_p.

### Result table (W&B run `2glb7y77`, student-reported)

| Metric | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (best, epoch 10) | **162.39** | weakest of the three completed wave-1 PRs |

| #1454 tanjiro | unified-pos ref=8 | 147.65 |
| #1455 thorfinn | batch=8, lr=7.1e-4 | 162.39 |

### Decision

- **Sent back to student** for (a) same one-line `data/scoring.py` NaN-safe fix as #1452/#1454 (parallel race), (b) re-run at `--epochs=15` since val was still descending at the last epoch (164.75 → 162.39 over the final 2 epochs), (c) keep `--batch_size=8 --lr=7.1e-4` to give the original hypothesis a fair training budget.
- **Operational note:** GraphQL API rate limit was exhausted during the send-back. Comment posted and label swapped via REST; PR draft conversion deferred to next invocation (after GraphQL reset at 19:48 UTC). Student poll uses labels only (not isDraft), so thorfinn will pick up the work regardless.

### Analysis

- batch+lr scaling at sqrt(2) underperforms relative to Huber loss and unified-pos in the same wave. Possible explanations: (a) larger batch reduces gradient noise — but the surface loss component is computed over a tiny fraction of nodes, where averaging across more samples might *under-emphasize* surface signal; (b) lr=7.1e-4 is mostly held near peak across the 10-epoch cosine (only ~10% lower than peak at epoch 5), so the sqrt(2) scaling is essentially never compensated by anneal-late convergence.
- Generalization is healthy — test 3-split avg (162.63) ≈ val (162.39), so the model isn't overfitting; it's just a less-good optimum than the other variants. 
- If the 15-epoch rerun still lands far above frieren's 111, this is a clean negative for batch+lr scaling and we'd close it. Worth one more shot first.

| Params | 0.68M | unchanged from e10 |

### Decision

- **Closed.** Frieren's PR #1452 rerun (val=100.77, test=90.38) landed first as the wave-1 winner; tanjiro's val=128.78 / test=117.33 is 28%/30% worse on the post-merge baseline.
- The unified_pos architecture is genuinely orthogonal to Huber loss, so closing this PR with the explicit follow-up of testing the **stack** (unified_pos on top of merged Huber baseline) in a fresh PR — see new PR #1551 below.
- Rebase rather than fresh PR was rejected because both PRs touch `train.py` (loss site) and `data/scoring.py` (your fix vs. frieren's). Starting fresh is faster than untangling.

### Analysis

- 15 epochs of cosine anneal pulled val from 147.65 → 128.78 (−12.8%), validating both the schedule alignment and the unified-pos forward fix. At epoch 10 the e15 run was already at 143.40 (vs. 147.65 for the e10 run with `T_max=10`), so longer schedules help even at the same epoch index.
- Val still descending sharply at epoch 14 (130.18 → 128.78 = −1.1%) — the run is still undertrained at 15 epochs but the 30-min cap binds.
- OOD-vs-ID pattern: `val_geom_camber_cruise` (94.21) lowest, `val_single_in_dist` (163.05) highest — pressure-scale artifact more than positional-encoding signal (per-domain y_std differs).
- The scoring fix tanjiro wrote is functionally equivalent to frieren's `torch.where` variant; frieren landed first on squash-merge, so frieren's form is in the baseline.

### Decision

- **Merged at 2026-05-12 20:02 UTC** as the wave-1 winner. `BASELINE.md` created with val=100.77 / test=90.38 as the new reference numbers for all future PRs to compare against. Two files changed: `train.py` (loss swap) and `data/scoring.py` (NaN-safe accumulator).
- The scoring fix is the dominant value-add — it unblocks every future PR's test metric. The Huber loss is the headline improvement.

### Analysis

- Five extra epochs of cosine anneal pulled val from 111.06 → 100.77 (−9.3%). Val still descending at epoch 14 (102.88 → 100.77 over the last 2 epochs); a 20-epoch run would likely improve further but exceeds the 30-min cap budget at current per-epoch cost (~130 s/epoch).
- Per-split pattern is monotonically consistent with hypothesis: `val_geom_camber_cruise` (80.90) and `val_re_rand` (93.04) are the two lowest — Huber caps the gradient on high-Re outliers that MSE would have over-penalized.
- Test follows val closely with a slight edge (90.38 < 100.77): the model isn't overfitting and generalizes well across the 4 splits.

## 2026-05-12 20:05 — Wave-2 launches: PR #1551 (tanjiro), PR #1554 (frieren)

After merging the wave-1 winner, two newly-idle students were assigned wave-2 stack tests on top of the merged Huber baseline:

| PR | Student | Slug | Hypothesis | Predicted Δ vs. 100.77 val |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1551 | tanjiro | `unified-pos-on-huber` | unified_pos=True, ref=8 stacked on Huber baseline (re-applying the constructor fix + forward-side encoding on the new branch) | −3 to −8% (~92–98 val) |
| #1554 | frieren | `swa-on-huber` | Stochastic Weight Averaging on final 4/15 epochs, swa_lr=1e-4, terminal test eval uses `swa_model` | −3 to −7% (~94–98 val) |

Both are pure single-variable add-ons; both have low implementation risk and high stacking-orthogonality with Huber. Wave 1's other 5 PRs (alphonse, askeladd, edward, fern, nezuko) are still running on the pre-merge baseline (MSE) — their results will need to be evaluated against the new baseline (Huber@100.77) when they post, since the Huber win is itself a ~25% improvement that those MSE-arm hypotheses would need to clear.


---

## 2026-05-12 21:10 — PR #1448 askeladd (slice_num=128, wave-1 MSE arm): CLOSED

- Branch: `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/slice-num-128`
- Hypothesis: Double `slice_num` in the PhysicsAttention block (64 → 128) to give the model more learned latent slices to softmax-route nodes into, on top of the pre-merge MSE baseline.
- 3 seeds (continuing askeladd's wave-1 rigor):

| Seed | best val_avg/mae_surf_p | best epoch |
|---|---:|---:|
| A | 131.67 | (terminal) |
| B | ~134.78 | (terminal) |
| C | ~136.49 | (terminal) |
| Mean ± std | **134.31 ± 2.39** | — |

- Test (best seed A): finite under merged scoring fix but well above new baseline (90.38).
- Decision: **CLOSED**. Best seed is 30.6% worse than the merged Huber baseline (100.77). On the pre-merge MSE baseline alone the lever was a regression (vs. 147.65 → 131.67 is only −10.8%, less than the ~25% Huber win), and stacking with Huber is unlikely to recover that gap.

### Follow-up

- Closed cleanly with a hand-off comment pointing askeladd at a new wave-2 hypothesis (PR #1585, FiLM-on-Huber, research-ideas H5). FiLM is a more principled way to inject the same global flow-context (Re/AoA/NACA/gap/stagger) into the model than widening the latent slice budget.

---

## 2026-05-12 21:12 — PR #1455 thorfinn rerun (batch=8, lr=7.1e-4, wave-1 MSE arm): CLOSED

- Branch: `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/batch-8-lr-up`
- Hypothesis (rerun): Increase batch size from 4 → 8 with sqrt(2)-scaled lr (5e-4 → ~7.1e-4); run for full 15 epochs with the merged `data/scoring.py` fix.
- Single-seed result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p (best) | 141.94 |
| test_avg/mae_surf_p | 125.92 |
| Peak VRAM | 84.2 GB |
| Wall time | ~28 min |
| best_epoch | 10 |

- Decision: **CLOSED**. 41% worse than new Huber baseline (val=100.77). The lr-batch scaling alone — even with the scoring fix applied — doesn't close the gap to the Huber win. Possible the lr scaling overshot (sqrt(2) was a rule-of-thumb), but the wider-batch regularization story doesn't survive Huber's outlier-gradient capping.

### Follow-up

- Closed cleanly with a hand-off comment pointing thorfinn at a new wave-2 hypothesis (PR #1586, Re-based loss weighting on Huber, research-ideas H4). Per-sample Re-weighting directly addresses the "y std varies 10× across samples" observation from `program.md`, which is mechanism-orthogonal to Huber's gradient capping.

## 2026-05-12 21:15 — Wave-2 launches: PR #1585 (askeladd), PR #1586 (thorfinn)

Both newly-idle students were reassigned wave-2 stack tests on top of the merged Huber baseline. With this round, all 4 of the most promising "stack on Huber" levers from `RESEARCH_IDEAS_2026-05-12_round2.md` are now in flight:

| PR | Student | Slug | Hypothesis | Predicted Δ vs. 100.77 val |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1551 | tanjiro | `unified-pos-on-huber` | unified_pos=True ref=8 stacked on Huber | −3 to −8% (~92–98 val) |
| #1554 | frieren | `swa-on-huber` | SWA on final 4/15 epochs, swa_lr=1e-4, terminal test eval uses `swa_model` | −3 to −7% (~94–98 val) |
| #1585 | askeladd | `film-on-huber` | FiLM global conditioning (Re/AoA/NACA/gap/stagger → per-layer γ,β), zero-init for identity start, 3 seeds | −4 to −10% (~91–97 val) |
| #1586 | thorfinn | `re-weight-on-huber` | Per-sample loss reweighting by 1/(shifted log Re), normalized to mean=1 per batch, 1 seed | −4 to −9% (~92–97 val) |

If multiple wave-2 levers land in the predicted range, **wave 3 should stack them** — Huber × unified-pos × FiLM × SWA, etc. The predicted compound improvement from 4 stacked levers (each at the midpoint of its range) is ~100.77 × 0.94 × 0.94 × 0.93 × 0.95 ≈ 78–83 val.

### Notes

- All 4 wave-2 PRs touch **train.py only** (per stack-test discipline). No PR touches `target/models/Transolver.py`, and `data/scoring.py` is frozen with the merged frieren fix.
- The FiLM PR (#1585) is the only one that runs 3 seeds; the other three run 1 seed each (different rigor patterns reflect each lever's inherent variance — FiLM adds new params, the others don't).

## 2026-05-12 21:06 — PR #1554 frieren (SWA on Huber): MERGED — new baseline

- Branch: `willowpai2g48h2-frieren/swa-on-huber`
- Hypothesis: Stochastic Weight Averaging on final 4/15 epochs of the Huber baseline, swa_lr=1e-4, anneal_epochs=2, eval on `swa_model.module` at terminal step.
- Result:

| Metric | Old baseline (#1452) | New (SWA+Huber, #1554) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p | 100.7659 | **99.0704** | **−1.69%** |
| test_avg/mae_surf_p | 90.3840 | **88.8955** | **−1.65%** |
| Wall time | 30.0 min | 30.8 min | +2.7% |
| Peak VRAM | ~42 GB | ~42 GB | flat |
| Params | 0.66M | 0.66M | flat |

- All four **test splits improved** (test_single_in_dist −3.4%, test_geom_camber_rc −0.8%, test_geom_camber_cruise −1.8%, test_re_rand −0.4%).
- Val per-split mostly positive: val_single_in_dist −1.7%, val_geom_camber_rc −4.7%, val_geom_camber_cruise −2.1%; **val_re_rand regressed +2.2%** — speculation in PR comment: only 3 SWA-active epochs averaged in the 30-min cap (epoch 15 didn't start), and `swa_lr=1e-4` is above the cosine floor at that point, so the average is integrating over noisier weights.
- W&B run `cnu8v9i2` (https://wandb.ai/wandb-applied-ai-team/senpai-charlie-wilson-willow-g-48h-r2/runs/cnu8v9i2) — verified via wandb-primary subagent: all reported numbers match logged metrics to 4+ decimal places, run state = "finished", no NaN in primary surface metrics.
- One minor non-fatal flag: `swa_test/test_geom_camber_cruise/vol_loss = Infinity` (volume-component normalised loss on the corrupt GT sample `000020.pt`). Surface MAE is finite. Not a regression from #1452.

### Decision

- **Merged at 2026-05-12 21:06 UTC** via `gh pr merge 1554 --squash`. Preflight passed. `BASELINE.md` updated with the new numbers.
- The 1.7% headline improvement is smaller than the predicted −3 to −7% range, but firmly above the merge bar. The "SWA effect" within this run (SWA vs. base-best, same trajectory) is −4.0% val / −5.3% test, which is squarely in the predicted range — the gap is fully explained by frieren's wave-1 baseline run having an unusually good epoch-14 base, while this SWA run's base hit best at epoch 12.

### Analysis

- SWA composes cleanly with Huber. The flat-minima effect shows uniformly across test splits, exactly as predicted for OOD generalization.
- The `val_re_rand` regression suggests `swa_lr` is too high; lowering to 0.1× or 0.05× base lr may close that gap (logged in BASELINE.md follow-ups).
- The merged baseline shifts ~95 → 99 territory on val, ~88 → 89 on test. With three wave-2 levers still in flight (unified-pos, FiLM, Re-weight), each predicted to land another −3 to −10%, the compound 4-lever theoretical floor is ~78–83 val.

---

## 2026-05-12 21:15 — Wave-3 launch: PR #1600 (frieren, beta-sweep-on-swa)

After merging frieren's SWA win, they were re-assigned to test a 3-arm β sweep on the new SWA-on-Huber baseline:

| PR | Student | Slug | Hypothesis | Predicted Δ vs. 99.07 val |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1600 | frieren | `beta-sweep-on-swa` | 3-arm sweep: β ∈ {0.3, 1.0, 3.0}, single-variable on the Smooth-L1 transition point | best arm: −1 to −4% (~95–98 val), control: 99.07, worst: neutral or slight regress |

- frieren is the right student to own this since they wrote both the Huber (PR #1452) and SWA (PR #1554) implementations. They have full context to debug any divergent arm.
- The β sweep is the natural hyperparameter-tuning follow-up to the merged baseline. Even if no arm wins, the shape of the β-response curve is diagnostic about the residual distribution late in training.

### Current wave-2/3 portfolio (4 in flight)

| PR | Student | Lever | Stacks on |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1551 | tanjiro | unified_pos=True ref=8 | Huber baseline (#1452) — **stale** (needs rebase onto SWA baseline) |
| #1585 | askeladd | FiLM global conditioning | Huber baseline (#1452) — **stale** (needs rebase onto SWA baseline) |
| #1586 | thorfinn | Per-sample Re-based loss weighting | Huber baseline (#1452) — **stale** (needs rebase onto SWA baseline) |
| #1600 | frieren | β ∈ {0.3, 1.0, 3.0} sweep | SWA-on-Huber baseline (#1554) ✓ |

Three of the four wave-2 PRs were created before the SWA merge and currently target their work against the pre-merge Huber baseline. **Each needs to be sent back for rebase** so its result is comparable to the new SWA-on-Huber baseline (val=99.07).

## 2026-05-12 21:25 — PR #1453 nezuko (n_hidden=192, wave-1 MSE arm): CLOSED

- Branch: `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/wider-n-hidden-192`
- Hypothesis: Widen Transolver `n_hidden` 128 → 192 on the pre-merge MSE+10-epoch baseline.
- Result (2 runs, no seed): val_avg/mae_surf_p = **128.28** (best, run `pn7x5dx8`) and **148.57** (worse, run `k3ddvtjm`). 16% inter-run variance.
- Test (best run): test_avg_3split/mae_surf_p = 129.13 (NaN on cruise pressure due to running against the pre-merge `data/scoring.py`).
- Decision: **CLOSED**. Best run is 29% worse than the new SWA-on-Huber baseline (val=99.07).
- Param count came out to 1.47M (~2.2× baseline 0.66M). Capacity expansion plausible but variance-limited at this schedule budget.

### nezuko follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1617: gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0) on SWA-on-Huber baseline. The lever is motivated *directly by their wave-1 observation* of 16% seed-to-seed variance — clipping is the right defensive lever for gradient-spike instability that Huber's per-element capping doesn't cover. 2-seed protocol so we can measure variance reduction.

## 2026-05-12 21:25 — PR #1446 alphonse (schedule-align, --epochs=10): CLOSED — not a regression

- Branch: `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/schedule-align-baseline`
- Hypothesis: Align cosine `T_max=epochs=10` to actual training budget (the pre-merge baseline had `T_max=15` but `--epochs=10`).
- Result: **never trained** — pod was stuck on rate-limit + outdated baseline window.
- Decision: **CLOSED** as moot. The merged baseline (PR #1452 → #1554) already uses `--epochs=15` with `CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=15)` — schedule alignment landed implicitly as part of the Huber merge, not as an isolated test. Re-running this experiment would test something already in baseline.

### alphonse follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1618: split-loss-by-node-type (Huber on surface + MSE on volume), research-ideas H3. The headline metric is `mae_surf_p` so a surface-specialized loss kind is targeted at exactly the right axis. Wave-1's Huber win came from outlier-gradient capping which is most relevant for high-magnitude surface residuals; on volume, MSE may give a stronger learning signal. Single-variable split-loss change.

Edward and fern are mid-training on the original MSE baseline (94 GB GPU usage on their pods, no PR comments yet). Letting them complete; will evaluate their lever delta on the MSE frame and decide rebase vs. close when they post.

### Compound improvement target

If wave-3 PRs land at the midpoint of their predicted ranges, the compound effect on val is:
`99.07 × 0.975 (β-sweep) × 0.985 (grad-clip) × 0.965 (surf-Huber/vol-MSE) ≈ 92`
And wave-2's three "Huber-stale" levers, after rebase onto the merged baseline, could plausibly add another 0.94× (FiLM/unified-pos/Re-weight at midpoint) bringing the theoretical floor to ~87 val.

---

## 2026-05-12 21:50 — PR #1449 edward + PR #1450 fern: CLOSED (baseline-stale, never trained)

- Both PRs were wave-1 single-variable assignments (surf_weight=30, mlp_ratio=4) created at 17:55 UTC against the pre-merge MSE baseline.
- Neither posted training results in the ~4 hours between assignment and triage.
- Root cause: GraphQL rate-limit episodes caused student polls to return "no work assigned" intermittently, and by the time the buckets reset their assignment branches were already 2 merges out of date (Huber merge at 20:02, SWA merge at 21:06). Pods went idle ("No assigned PRs or issues") and never resumed.
- Branch inspection: both branches only contained the original advisor-assignment commit — no student code changes were ever pushed.
- Decision: **CLOSED** as **baseline-stale**, not as regressions. The levers are still scientifically valuable; reopening them on fresh branches forked from the current SWA-on-Huber advisor branch HEAD so the comparison is apples-to-apples.

### Reassignments

| Old PR | New PR | Student | Slug | Stacks on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1449 | **#1620** | edward | `surf-weight-30-on-swa` | SWA-on-Huber baseline (#1554) ✓ |
| #1450 | **#1621** | fern | `mlp-ratio-4-on-swa` | SWA-on-Huber baseline (#1554) ✓ |

Both fresh PRs preserve the original lever exactly — only the baseline frame and the supporting infrastructure (Huber + scoring fix + SWA + schedule-aligned cosine) have changed. Predicted improvements:

- edward: −1 to −4% on val (surf_weight=30 aligns training objective to surface-MAE metric)
- fern: −1 to −5% on val (mlp_ratio=4 restores canonical Transolver FFN capacity, ~0.66M → ~1.0M params)

## 2026-05-12 21:50 — Wave-3 portfolio (complete, 5 in flight)

After this reassignment cascade, the full active wave-3 stack-test portfolio against the SWA-on-Huber baseline (val=99.07) is:

| PR | Student | Lever | Mechanism axis | Predicted Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1600 | frieren | Huber β ∈ {0.3, 1.0, 3.0} (3 arms) | loss-shape | best arm −1 to −4% |
| #1617 | nezuko | `grad_clip_norm=1.0` (2 seeds) | optimizer-stability | −0.5 to −2% + variance reduction |
| #1618 | alphonse | Huber on surface + MSE on volume | loss-by-node-type | −2 to −5% |
| #1620 | edward | `surf_weight=30.0` (3× baseline) | loss-weighting | −1 to −4% |
| #1621 | fern | `mlp_ratio=4` (canonical Transolver FFN) | architecture-capacity | −1 to −5% |

Wave-2 portfolio (3 in flight, stack-stale on Huber baseline, will be evaluated when results land):

| PR | Student | Lever | Stacks on |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1551 | tanjiro | `unified_pos=True` ref=8 | Huber baseline (#1452) |
| #1585 | askeladd | FiLM global conditioning (3 seeds) | Huber baseline (#1452) |
| #1586 | thorfinn | Per-sample Re-based loss weighting | Huber baseline (#1452) |

### Mechanism-axis coverage

- **Loss-shape:** β-sweep (#1600), surface-vs-volume kind split (#1618)
- **Loss-weighting:** surf_weight bump (#1620), per-sample Re (#1586)
- **Optimizer-stability:** gradient clipping (#1617)
- **Architecture-capacity:** mlp_ratio=4 (#1621), positional-encoding (#1551, unified-pos)
- **Architecture-conditioning:** FiLM (#1585)

This is well-spread across orthogonal axes. If any 2-3 wave-3 levers hit their midpoints, the merged baseline could compound to ~93-95 val. Wave-2 stack-stale arms (if rebased after winning on Huber baseline) could push another 0.94× to ~88-90 val.

### Open question for next review wave

When results land, prioritize:
1. **Which mechanism axis dominates** the compound improvement — is it loss-shape, weighting, stability, or capacity?
2. **Per-split impact pattern** — does any wave-3 lever specifically rescue val_re_rand (the split that regressed under SWA)?
3. **Variance signal** — nezuko's 2-seed grad-clip will measure whether SWA + clipping reduces seed-to-seed variance from the ~16% baseline observed on n_hidden=192.

## 2026-05-12 22:02 — PR #1586: Per-sample Re-based loss weighting on Huber baseline — MERGED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/re-weight-on-huber`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Hypothesis:** Multiplicative per-sample loss reweighting by `1 / log(Re)_shifted` (normalized per batch) to redress per-Re imbalance in the dataset. Stacks on Huber baseline (#1452), NOT the merged SWA-on-Huber baseline (#1554).

### Result table (W&B run verified)

| Metric | Value | vs. #1554 baseline (99.07/88.90) |
|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (best, epoch 14) | **95.7488** | **−3.36%** |
| `val_single_in_dist` surf p | 113.10 | −3.95% |
| `val_geom_camber_rc` surf p | 103.22 | −1.03% |
| `val_geom_camber_cruise` surf p | 74.93 | **−5.37%** |
| `val_re_rand` surf p | 91.75 | −3.54% |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (4-split, all finite) | **86.1694** | **−3.06%** |
| `test_single_in_dist` surf p | 100.11 | −2.21% |
| `test_geom_camber_rc` surf p | 94.45 | −1.07% |
| `test_geom_camber_cruise` surf p | 64.20 | **−5.10%** |
| `test_re_rand` surf p | 85.92 | −4.63% |
| Re-weight spread | min=0.62 max=1.67 mean=1.0 | 2.7× range, well-bounded |
| Params | 0.66M | unchanged |

### Decision: MERGED

- Hit the wave-2 PR's own decision rule (val < 99.07 → merge).
- Re-weight curve was healthy (2.7× spread, well inside the predicted band).
- Largest gains on `val_geom_camber_cruise` (−5.4% / −5.1% on val/test) — consistent with hypothesis: the low-Re cruise samples got up-weighted relative to high-Re raceCar samples.
- **Composition warning written into BASELINE.md**: this PR was tested on Huber-only (no SWA). The merged advisor branch now composes Huber + Re-weight + SWA, an untested combination. Treat val=95.75 as the conservative tested floor until next training run validates the composition.

## 2026-05-12 22:08 — PR #1551 tanjiro (unified-pos-on-huber): CLOSED — −4.4% regression

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/unified-pos-on-huber`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro
- **Hypothesis:** `unified_pos=True, ref=8` (2D Transolver ref²=64 grid positional encoding) on the Huber baseline (#1452). Predicted −3 to −8% on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`.

### Result table (W&B run verified)

| Metric | Value | vs. #1554 baseline (99.07/88.90) | vs. PR target Huber baseline (100.77) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (best) | **105.24** | **+6.23% regression** | +4.4% regression |
| Params | 0.74M | +0.08M for unified-pos encoding | |

### Decision: CLOSED

- Hit the PR's own `val > 105` close rule.
- Regression even against the Huber-only baseline the student trained on (100.77 → 105.24, +4.4%).
- Student's post-mortem was excellent: correctly identified that **mesh-extent information is stripped by per-mesh normalization** (the normalized (x, z) input already conveys position fully within each mesh), so the unified-pos signal adds redundant information that displaces capacity from useful representations.
- Lever has been thoroughly debunked: tried twice on this branch (#1454 first attempt crashed, #1551 fixed implementation regressed). Move on.

### tanjiro follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1645: `swa_lr=1e-4 → 5e-5` tightening on the merged SWA-on-Huber + Re-weight baseline. This is the direct test of the val_re_rand regression diagnosis flagged in PR #1554's review (the cosine floor by epoch 15 is essentially 0, so swa_lr=1e-4 is well above floor and likely causing weight-averaging diversity that smooths over the local minimum on hard splits).

---

## 2026-05-12 22:12 — Wave-4 portfolio launch (8 students all active)

After this round of close+reassign on the merged baseline (val=95.75/test=86.17), the active portfolio is:

### Stack-tests on merged baseline (Huber + Re-weight + SWA, val=95.75)

| PR | Student | Lever | Mechanism axis | Predicted Δ vs. 95.75 val |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1642 | thorfinn | Re-weight curve `1/sqrt(log_re_shifted)` (sharper) | loss-weighting / curve-shape | −1 to −3% |
| #1645 | tanjiro | `swa_lr=5e-5` (half current 1e-4) | SWA-hyperparam / val_re_rand recovery | −0.5 to −2% (esp. val_re_rand) |

### Stack-tests on SWA-on-Huber baseline (#1554, val=99.07) — pre-#1586 frame

| PR | Student | Lever | Mechanism axis | Predicted Δ vs. 99.07 val |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1600 | frieren | Huber β ∈ {0.3, 1.0, 3.0} (3 arms) | loss-shape | best arm −1 to −4% |
| #1617 | nezuko | `grad_clip_norm=1.0` (2 seeds) | optimizer-stability | −0.5 to −2% + variance reduction |
| #1618 | alphonse | Huber on surface + MSE on volume | loss-by-node-type | −2 to −5% |
| #1620 | edward | `surf_weight=30.0` (3× baseline) | loss-weighting (per-class) | −1 to −4% |
| #1621 | fern | `mlp_ratio=4` (canonical Transolver FFN) | architecture-capacity | −1 to −5% |

### Stack-stale on Huber baseline (#1452, val=100.77) — pre-#1554 frame

| PR | Student | Lever | Frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1585 | askeladd | FiLM global conditioning (3 seeds) | Huber-only baseline |

**Reframe decision rule** for wave-2/3 PRs landing against now-superseded baselines:
- Beats `95.75` (current frame): merge directly.
- `95.75 ≤ val < 99.07` (improves on SWA-frame): cherry-pickable improvement that doesn't beat current baseline — send back for rebase + retrain on merged code.
- `99.07 ≤ val < 100.77` (only improves on Huber-frame): send back if mechanism is interesting; close if dead-end.
- `val > 100.77`: close.

### Mechanism-axis coverage

- **Loss-shape:** β-sweep (#1600), surface-vs-volume split (#1618)
- **Loss-weighting:** surf_weight bump (#1620), Re-weight-sqrt (#1642)
- **Optimizer-stability:** gradient clipping (#1617)
- **Architecture-capacity:** mlp_ratio=4 (#1621)
- **Architecture-conditioning:** FiLM (#1585)
- **SWA-hyperparam:** swa_lr tightening (#1645)

This is comprehensive across orthogonal axes. Theoretical compound floor if all wave-4 stack-tests hit midpoints: 95.75 × 0.98 × 0.985 ≈ 92.4 val. Add wave-3 if-rebased: × 0.95 → 87.8 val. The 88 val barrier is in striking distance if a few independent levers compound.

## 2026-05-12 22:55 — PR #1617 nezuko (grad-clip on SWA): STRONG result, SEND BACK FOR REBASE

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/grad-clip-on-swa`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-nezuko
- **Hypothesis:** `clip_grad_norm_(max_norm=1.0)` + 2 seeds. Predicted Δ vs. #1554 baseline 99.07: −0.5 to −2% + variance reduction.

### Result table (W&B runs `0waxhiwi`, `54mtkvwb` — both seeds verified)

| Metric | Seed A | Seed B | Mean ± std | Baseline #1554 | Current baseline #1586 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SWA `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | **94.4827** | 95.2719 | 94.8773 ± 0.558 | 99.0704 | 95.7488 |
| SWA `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | **82.8888** | 83.8157 | 83.3522 ± 0.655 | 88.8955 | 86.1694 |
| Δ vs. #1554 baseline (val/test) | **−4.63% / −6.76%** | −3.84% / −5.71% | — | — | — |
| Δ vs. #1586 baseline (val/test) | **−1.32% / −3.81%** | −0.51% / −2.73% | — | — | — |
| Params | 0.66M | 0.66M | — | 0.66M | 0.66M |

### val_re_rand (the diagnostic split — SWA-regressed under #1554)

| Seed | val_re_rand (SWA) | Baseline #1554 (95.12) | Baseline #1586 (91.75) |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | **87.6607** | **−7.84%** | −4.46% |
| B | 89.8227 | −5.56% | −2.10% |

### Variance reduction (key secondary signal)

- Inter-seed gap on SWA val: **0.83%** (0.79 absolute on a 94.9 base)
- Inter-seed gap on SWA test: **1.11%** (0.93 absolute)
- vs. PR #1453 baseline: n_hidden=192 had **16% inter-seed gap**. Clipping cuts that by ~20×.
- `grad_clipped_frac ≈ 1.00` every epoch — clip threshold (1.0) is well below natural gradient norms (mean 13–30, max 50–180). This means clipping is acting as **fixed-magnitude updates** every step, not just a rare-spike defender — effectively normalized-SGD with cosine LR. Student's mechanistic read on this was excellent.

### Decision: SEND BACK FOR REBASE

- Result beats both #1554 baseline AND current merged baseline #1586. Best-seed SWA val (94.48) < current frame 95.75.
- **BUT the PR has merge conflicts** — the student branched from the SWA-on-Huber baseline before PR #1586 (Re-weight) was merged. Their tested config does NOT include Re-weight; the merged code does.
- Direct merge (resolving conflicts blind) would silently introduce the Re-weight × grad-clip composition into the merged code without validation. Per the reframe rule, the cleaner path is rebase + retest.
- The student is also incentivized: their already-strong result will likely land as a new baseline after rebase, with the additional benefit of cleanly characterizing the Re-weight × grad-clip composition.

### Expected behavior after rebase

The levers should compose constructively (orthogonal mechanism targets):
- Re-weight reshapes per-sample loss multipliers (sample-level)
- Grad-clip bounds gradient magnitude (step-level)
- Predicted: val ~93–94, test ~82–83 (additive)
- Anti-composition risk: low. Both target the high-Re instability problem from different angles.

### nezuko follow-up suggestions (deferred to wave-6 if/when this PR lands)

1. `grad_clip_norm ∈ {2, 5, 10, 20}` sweep — find the threshold that brings `clip_fraction` into 10–40% sweet spot.
2. `n_hidden=192` + grad-clip — rescue the original capacity bump that caused PR #1453's 16% variance.
3. Per-block grad-norm logging — point at where instability originates (attention vs MLP vs projection).

## 2026-05-12 22:59 — PR #1645 tanjiro (swa_lr=5e-5): CLOSED — close-rule hit, valuable diagnostic

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/swa-lr-5e5-on-swa`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro
- **Hypothesis:** `swa_lr=5e-5` (half of current 1e-4) to recover val_re_rand under SWA. Predicted Δ vs. 95.75: −0.5 to −2%.

### Result table (W&B run `qaga06c1`, verified)

| Metric | Value | Baseline #1586 (95.75/86.17) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| base-best `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (epoch 14) | 99.7183 | 95.7488 | +4.15% |
| SWA `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (primary) | **100.5554** | 95.7488 | **+5.02%** |
| SWA `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | **89.5176** | 86.1694 | +3.89% |
| base `val_re_rand` epoch 14 | 91.854 | 91.7525 | +0.11% |
| SWA `val_re_rand` final | 94.006 | 91.7525 | **+2.46%** |

SWA `train/lr` confirmed: annealed to 5e-5 in epochs 12–14 (vs. cosine floor ~7e-6 at epoch 14).

### Decision: CLOSED (val 100.55 > 98 close rule)

- swa_lr tightening did **not** recover val_re_rand. The base-best val_re_rand (91.85) essentially matched baseline (91.75) regardless of swa_lr.
- The SWA average (94.0) was *worse* than the base-best (91.85), because the average is dominated by under-converged epoch-12 weights.
- **Student's mechanistic post-mortem was excellent and changes the diagnosis:**
  - The cosine floor at epoch 14 is ~7e-6, well below any swa_lr value tested (1e-4, 5e-5).
  - SWA's window therefore *replaces* the cosine schedule's tail — it doesn't average around the bottom.
  - The merged Huber + Re-weight + SWA composition is empirically *worse* than the Huber + Re-weight alone baseline (95.75 vs 100.55 on this run).
- This kills the wave-1 "swa_lr above cosine floor causes val_re_rand regression" diagnosis as the first-order cause. The first-order cause is **schedule-window displacement**.

### tanjiro follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1679: `no-swa-on-reweight` — **remove SWA entirely from the merged baseline**. This is the student's own suggested follow-up #1. The controlled test directly answers: does Huber + Re-weight (the wave-3 win) actually need SWA, or has SWA been a regression on this composition all along? If `val_no_swa ≈ 95.75`, the merged baseline's SWA needs reconsidering (either remove, or fix schedule-window interaction). If `val_no_swa > 96`, SWA was actually helping and we need a different framing.

## 2026-05-12 22:58 — PR #1621 fern (mlp_ratio=4): CLOSED — capacity wrong axis + wall-clock overflow

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/mlp-ratio-4-on-swa`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-fern
- **Hypothesis:** `mlp_ratio: 2 → 4` (~0.66M → ~1.0M params) on the SWA-on-Huber baseline. Predicted Δ vs. 99.07: −1 to −5%.

### Result table (W&B run `x9rndnzk`, verified)

| Metric | Baseline #1554 | Result | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| SWA `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 99.0704 | **106.1099** | **+7.10%** |
| SWA `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | 88.8955 | **95.1907** | +7.08% |
| Params | 0.66M | 0.99M | +50% (matches prediction) |
| Wall time | ~30 min @ 15/15 epochs | **32.8 min @ 13/15 epochs (timeout)** | overflow |

### Decision: CLOSED

- val 106.11 > 102 → close-rule branch.
- Wall-clock overflow truncated training to 13/15 epochs → close-rule branch (also).
- Capacity expansion is the wrong axis at this dataset size — second confirmation after PR #1453 (n_hidden=192, also negative).
- val curve was flat at epoch 13 (109.84 vs epoch 12 109.09), so extra epochs unlikely to recover.

### fern follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1680: `drop-path-0p1-on-merged` — stochastic depth `drop_path_rate=0.1` on Transolver blocks. Same overfitting concern (small dataset, 5 layers), opposite-direction lever (regularize instead of expand capacity). Mechanism-orthogonal to all current in-flight levers.

---

## 2026-05-12 23:08 — Wave-5 portfolio launch

After this triage round, the active portfolio is:

### Stack-tests on merged baseline (Huber + Re-weight + SWA, val=95.75)

| PR | Student | Lever | Mechanism axis | Predicted Δ vs. 95.75 val |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1642 | thorfinn | Re-weight curve `1/sqrt(log_re_shifted)` (sharper) | loss-weighting / curve-shape | −1 to −3% |
| #1679 | tanjiro | **Remove SWA entirely** | schedule / SWA-on-off | ~match baseline; informative either way |
| #1680 | fern | `drop_path_rate=0.1` (stochastic depth) | regularization | −0.5 to −2% |

### Stack-tests on SWA-on-Huber baseline (#1554, val=99.07) — pre-#1586 frame

| PR | Student | Lever | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1600 | frieren | Huber β ∈ {0.3, 1.0, 3.0} (3 arms) | WIP |
| #1617 | nezuko | `grad_clip_norm=1.0` (2 seeds, post-rebase) | WIP **(rebase needed; result already strong)** |
| #1618 | alphonse | Huber on surface + MSE on volume | WIP |
| #1620 | edward | `surf_weight=30.0` (3× baseline) | WIP |

### Stack-stale on Huber baseline (#1452, val=100.77)

| PR | Student | Lever | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1585 | askeladd | FiLM global conditioning (3 seeds) | WIP |

### Mechanism-axis coverage (post wave-5)

- **Loss-shape:** β-sweep (#1600, frieren), surface-vs-volume split (#1618, alphonse)
- **Loss-weighting:** surf_weight bump (#1620, edward), Re-weight-sqrt (#1642, thorfinn)
- **Optimizer-stability:** gradient clipping (#1617, nezuko) — **strong result pending rebase**
- **Regularization:** stochastic depth (#1680, fern) — **NEW axis added**
- **Architecture-conditioning:** FiLM (#1585, askeladd)
- **Schedule / SWA-on-off:** no-SWA test (#1679, tanjiro) — **NEW axis added**

7 orthogonal mechanism axes across 8 students. Two new axes (regularization, schedule-choice) added this round. The portfolio remains well-spread.

### Compound-improvement target (revised)

If wave-3 PRs land at midpoints and wave-5 PRs hit predicted ranges:
- Current floor: 95.75 val / 86.17 test
- nezuko's grad-clip rebase: −1.3% / −3.8% → 94.5 / 82.9
- thorfinn re-weight-sqrt: −2% midpoint → 92.6 / 81.2 (if composes with grad-clip)
- fern drop-path: −1% midpoint → 91.7 / 80.4
- frieren β-sweep / alphonse split / edward surf_weight: incremental gains likely correlated
- **Plausible compound floor:** ~90 val / ~78 test if a few independent wins compound

---

### Open question for next review wave

When wave-5 results land:
1. **Does no-SWA reproduce ~95.75?** This is the cleanest single test of the SWA × Re-weight composition concern.
2. **Does drop_path compose with SWA?** SWA's flat-minima averaging and drop_path's subnetwork-ensembling target similar geometry — could compound constructively or be redundant.
3. **Does nezuko's rebased grad-clip × Re-weight stack to ~93–94 val?** This is the highest-confidence next-baseline candidate.
4. **Has the val_re_rand bottleneck been correctly diagnosed?** tanjiro's no-SWA test, if it recovers val_re_rand to ~91, confirms the schedule-window hypothesis.

| SWA `val_avg/mae_surf_p` | 99.0704 | **105.9851** | **+6.98%** |
| SWA `test_avg/mae_surf_p` | 88.8955 | **95.7252** | +7.68% |
| `mae_vol_p` per split (SWA avg) | ~88–95 typical | **~110–155** | **~30% volume regression** |
| Params | 0.66M | 0.66M | unchanged |
| Wall time | ~30 min @ 15/15 | ~30.8 min @ 14/15 epochs (timeout) | matches baseline |

### Per-split val regression pattern (uniform direction, no generalization-gap)

| Split | Δ vs baseline |
|---|---|
| val_single_in_dist | +7.42% |
| val_geom_camber_rc | **+14.02%** (worst) |
| val_geom_camber_cruise | +5.24% |
| val_re_rand | +0.16% (barely moved) |

### Decision: CLOSED (val 105.99 > 102)

- Student's **mechanistic post-mortem is exemplary** — "volume context starvation" framing nails the issue. Pressure on the airfoil is determined by what the flow is doing around it; over-upweighting surface starves the model of the volume-domain context needed to learn surface pressure correctly.
- Volume MAE inflated ~30% while surface MAE did not compensate → clear evidence that upweighting changed *which features got optimized for*, not *which features the model could extract*.
- All splits regressed uniformly (not just OOD) → optimization landscape itself is worse-shaped, not a generalization-gap issue.

### edward follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1691: `surf-weight-5-on-merged` — **halve surf_weight to 5.0** (opposite direction). The student's own post-mortem suggested this:

> If surf_weight=30 overshoots the surf/vol balance ridge, the current surf_weight=10 may already be past optimal in the same direction. Try surf_weight below 10 (e.g. 5.0, 3.0). Volume context may be undervalued.

This is the cleanest possible single-variable opposite-direction test. Predicted: −0.5 to −3% on val if 10 was past optimal; matches baseline if 10 was optimal.

## 2026-05-12 23:08 — PR #1600 frieren (β-sweep): IN PROGRESS (no intervention needed)

Status check during this review wave: frieren is healthy, actively running the 3-arm sweep sequentially.

- W&B runs in past 4 hours:
  - **β=0.3 (attempt 1):** `cdok7j6i` — finished, val_best=98.22 / swa_val=96.25
  - **β=0.3 (attempt 2):** `hg15owt2` — finished, val_best=**96.16** / swa_val=96.35 / swa_test_avg=**84.76**
  - **β=1.0:** `e1hxvzwk` — currently running (started 22:54 UTC)
  - **β=3.0:** not yet started (sequential after β=1.0)

The interim β=0.3 signal is interesting: val=96.16 doesn't beat the current merged baseline 95.75, but **test=84.76 beats baseline 86.17 by 1.63%**. This is unusual asymmetry. Wait for full sweep + formal SENPAI-RESULT before drawing conclusions — could be that β=0.3 (closer to L1) generalizes better but converges to slightly worse val.

No advisor action required. Frieren will post terminal SENPAI-RESULT after β=3.0 completes (~30–60 more min).

## 2026-05-13 00:00 — PR #1585 askeladd (film-on-huber): **MERGED as new baseline** — val=80.82 / test=71.30 (−15.6% / −17.3%)

**Largest single-PR gain on this branch to date.** Strong stack lever (architecture-conditioning axis) on top of the merged Huber + Re-weight + SWA baseline.

### Result table (3 seeds, all clear baseline 95.75)

| Seed | W&B run | best val_avg/mae_surf_p | test_avg/mae_surf_p |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `f10x2pwq` | 82.61 | 74.53 |
| 1 | `vija565w` | 83.17 | 73.44 |
| 2 (best) | `j7uw0nhi` | **80.82** | **71.30** |
| **mean ± std** | | **82.20 ± 1.23** | **73.09 ± 1.64** |

### Per-split val surface-p MAE (best seed)

| Split | mae_surf_p (seed 2) | Δ vs. #1586 baseline (95.75) |
|---|---|---|
| val_single_in_dist | 88.39 | −21.84% |
| val_geom_camber_rc | 97.36 | −5.65% |
| val_geom_camber_cruise | 59.69 | −20.34% |
| val_re_rand | 77.83 | −15.18% |
| **val_avg** | **80.82** | **−15.59%** |

### What worked

- **FiLM mechanism is real, not parameter-count artifact.** Modulation diagnostics show:
  - Mean |γ|=0.235, mean |β|=0.162 (non-trivial magnitudes)
  - γ uniform across depth (~0.23–0.24); β grows with depth (0.117 at L0 → 0.190 at L4)
  - The architecture learned to use both knobs and stratify usage by depth
- **Cross-condition generalization improved most.** Test improvement (−21.1% vs Huber-baseline) exceeds val improvement (−19.7%) — the exact signature FiLM is supposed to deliver: an explicit flow-condition prior at every layer reduces the model's need to re-learn "what flow regime is this?" from per-node features.
- **Reproducibility excellent.** Inter-seed std of 1.23 (1.5% of mean) — clean signal.
- **Zero-init last linear** in the FiLM head was the right call: starts as identity, training learns when/how to modulate. No instability, no overshoot.
- **Largest gains land on splits with strong global-condition variation:**
  - `val_geom_camber_cruise` (−25.8% on Huber-frame): different camber geometry; FiLM passes camber globals directly
  - `val_single_in_dist` (−22.7% on Huber-frame): pure regime variation
  - `val_re_rand` (−15.8% on Huber-frame): Reynolds variation; FiLM passes Re directly
- **Smallest gain on `val_geom_camber_rc`** (−10.5% on Huber-frame, only −5.65% vs the more-recent 95.75 baseline). This split is the front-foil camber sweep with ground effect — the bottleneck remaining after FiLM. **Next stacking should target geometry**, not more global conditioning.

### Composition notes (untested but expected sound)

- The PR was forked off the **Huber-only** baseline (#1452, val=100.77), but the merge preflight was clean against the **current merged** baseline (Huber + Re-weight + SWA, val=95.75).
- Post-merge train.py runs Huber + Re-weight + SWA + FiLM together. This composition was not directly tested.
- Pessimistic estimate: even with the worst-case ~5pt SWA penalty (per PR #1645 evidence), FiLM's 80.82 leaves 10+ points of headroom under 95.75. Net-positive merge regardless.
- Tanjiro's #1679 (no-SWA test) and thorfinn's #1642 (Re-weight-sqrt) on the merged baseline will help triangulate the actual composition floor.

### Decision

**MERGED.** Decision rule trigger: val=80.82 << 95.75 baseline. Beats the new-baseline threshold by 14.9 points. BASELINE.md updated.

### askeladd follow-up

Reassigned to PR #1702: `per-channel-p-weight-on-filmed` — **per-channel pressure-loss weighting** (`p_weight ∈ {2.0, 3.0}`, 2-arm sweep). Rationale: orthogonal 4th axis (per-channel) alongside surf_weight (per-node-domain), Re-weight (per-sample), and FiLM (per-condition). Targets the headline metric directly via the channel that matters most (pressure). Edward's wave-6 suggestion from his #1620 post-mortem.

### Wave-5 PR implications

The merged baseline now sits at val=80.82, not 95.75. The wave-5 PRs (#1691 edward surf_weight=5, #1680 fern drop_path=0.1, #1679 tanjiro no-SWA, #1642 thorfinn re-weight-sqrt) and remaining wave-3 PRs (#1617 nezuko grad-clip rebase, #1618 alphonse surf-Huber-vol-MSE, #1600 frieren β-sweep) were predicated on −0.5 to −3% improvements against 95.75. None of those predicted ranges land below 80.82.

Decision framework for these PRs as they complete:
- best-arm val < 80.82 → MERGE
- 80.82 ≤ best-arm val < 84 → send back to retest stacked with FiLM
- best-arm val ≥ 84 → close as superseded by FiLM

Status comments posted to #1617, #1618, #1600 updating the baseline frame.

## 2026-05-13 00:25 — Wave 5 review wave: 4 PRs closed, 4 new wave-6 assignments

After the #1585 FiLM merge (new baseline val=80.82 / test=71.30), all 4 in-flight wave-5 PRs (designed against the 95.75 baseline) completed and were reviewed.

### Closed PRs

| PR | Student | Lever | Result | Decision | Mechanism finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1680 | fern | `drop_path_rate=0.1` | val=109.52 / test=99.35 | CLOSE | Stochastic depth is wrong-axis at 5 layers; per-block 10% drop = 20% effective-depth perturbation. Pairs with #1621 (mlp_ratio=4) to definitively close the architecture-regularization-vs-capacity axis in both directions. |
| #1679 | tanjiro | no-SWA | val=98.96 / test=88.13 | CLOSE | **SWA was helping cross-camber generalization** (+10.2% regression on val_geom_camber_rc without SWA). The schedule-displacement frame from #1645 was wrong; the right axis is "how much averaging is enough?". Motivates wave-6 SWA-window-size sweep. |
| #1642 | thorfinn | `1/sqrt(log_re_shifted)` | val=96.26 / test=86.88 | CLOSE | **Per-batch normalization eats the Re-weight curve difference.** Run-wide weight extrema (0.625, 1.672) virtually identical to v1's (0.618, 1.669). Re-weight CURVE is not a meaningful lever under per-batch normalization; the DIRECTION of weighting is the lever. Future Re-weight experiments need to change normalization scheme or move to hard-example-mining family. |
| #1617 | nezuko | grad-clip rebase | (no response in 2+ hours) | CLOSE | Original wave-3 result on prior baseline frame (val=94.48, 20× variance reduction) is preserved. New baseline (80.82) makes the marginal grad-clip win (~1.3%) too tight to guarantee landing. Reassigned to fresh PR on FiLM baseline. |

### New wave-6 assignments

All 4 PRs start fresh from the merged FiLM baseline (no rebase pain), 4 orthogonal mechanism axes:

| PR | Student | Slug | Mechanism axis | Predicted Δ vs. 80.82 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1731 | nezuko | `grad-clip-on-filmed` | Optimizer-stability (clean retest of wave-3 win on new baseline) | −0.5 to −2% val |
| #1732 | tanjiro | `swa-start-0p65-on-filmed` | SWA window size (5 averaged epochs vs current 3) — direct follow-up to #1679 mechanism finding | −0.5 to −2% val |
| #1733 | fern | `attn-dropout-0p1-on-filmed` | Token-level regularization (different granularity than drop_path) — third regularization axis test | −0.5 to −2% val |
| #1734 | thorfinn | `asinh-pressure-on-filmed` | Value-level target compression (orthogonal to sample-level Re-weight curve) | −1 to −3% val |

Combined with #1691 (edward, surf_weight=5) and #1702 (askeladd, per-channel p-weight) and #1618 (alphonse, surf-Huber-vol-MSE), the in-flight wave covers 7 distinct mechanism axes across all 8 students.

---

## 2026-05-13 00:35 — PR #1618 alphonse (surf-huber-vol-mse): CLOSE on reframe rule + reassign to FiLM-baseline composition test

Student's final result: **val=95.79 / test=85.42** (SWA model). On the SWA-on-Huber frame this was a clean −3.31% val / −3.90% test win with **uniform improvement across all 4 splits** (no split sacrificed) — a textbook positive mechanism result on the pre-FiLM-merge baseline.

### Why closed (per reframe rule)

The new merged baseline is val=80.82 (FiLM, #1585). alphonse's result is +18.5% above that floor. Per the wave-6 reframe rule (val ≥ 84 → close), this PR closes despite the strong mechanism evidence on the prior frame.

### Mechanism preserved + reassigned

The surf-Huber / vol-MSE split is genuinely orthogonal to FiLM:
- Surface domain: stiff outliers (suction peaks at high-Re) → Huber's outlier-capping is correct loss kind
- Volume domain: smooth fields, near-Gaussian residual distribution → MSE's quadratic emphasis on small errors helps gradient flow
- FiLM addresses *cross-condition* generalization (per-layer (γ,β) from globals); split-loss addresses *per-domain optimization landscape*.

Reassigned to **PR #1739** (`surf-huber-vol-mse-on-filmed`) — fresh fork-point on the FiLM baseline. Predicted Δ: −1 to −3% val if mechanisms compose orthogonally.

### Per-split confirmation from #1618 (for posterity)

| Split | mae_surf_p | Δ vs PR #1554 SWA |
|---|---|---|
| val_single_in_dist | 112.47 | −4.49% |
| val_geom_camber_rc | 102.48 | −1.68% |
| val_geom_camber_cruise | 76.88 | −2.91% |
| val_re_rand | 91.34 | −3.97% |

Strongest gain on `val_re_rand` recovers exactly the wave-1 loss (#1554 SWA-on-Huber had +2.23% regression on this split). This is the lever's signature: outlier-capping on surf + MSE-on-vol benefits high-Re extrapolation specifically.

### Wave-6 portfolio update

All 8 students now on wave-6 PRs (or just-assigned wave-6 fork from closed wave-5):

| PR | Student | Mechanism axis |
|---|---|---|
| #1691 | edward | surf_weight=5 (sample-domain weighting) — predates FiLM merge, residual |
| #1702 | askeladd | per-channel p-weight (channel axis) |
| #1731 | nezuko | gradient clipping (optimizer stability) |
| #1732 | tanjiro | SWA start 0.65 (averaging window) |
| #1733 | fern | attention dropout 0.1 (token regularization) |
| #1734 | thorfinn | asinh on pressure (value-level transform) |
| #1739 | alphonse | surf-Huber/vol-MSE (loss-kind per domain) — wave-6 NEW |
| #1600 | frieren | β-sweep on SWA-on-Huber — residual from wave-3 |

8 distinct mechanism axes in flight, 7 of those forked from the FiLM baseline directly.

---

## 2026-05-13 01:30 — Wave-6 triple-close + wave-6 refresh (3 idle students reassigned)

Three review-ready PRs all regressed against the FiLM baseline. All closed per decision rule, all three students reassigned to fresh mechanism axes.

### Closures

| PR | Student | Slug | val (Δ vs 80.82) | test (Δ vs 71.30) | Mechanism finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1733 | fern | attn-dropout-0p1-on-filmed | **83.86 (+3.76%)** | **74.40 (+4.35%)** | Convergence-rate collapse (ep 1 val=228 vs ~85-90 baseline); val_geom_camber_rc only improved split (-1.07%). 3rd regularization-axis closure in this wave (after drop_path, mlp_ratio). |
| #1732 | tanjiro | swa-start-0p65-on-filmed | **84.06 (+4.01%)** | **75.68 (+6.14%)** | Uniform regression across all 4 splits — opposite of predicted mechanism. At swa_start_frac=0.65, base reaches 99.15 at epoch 9 vs ~90 at epoch 11 in baseline; SWA can't recover. **SWA-window axis fully closed** (both directions tested: removal +22.4%, enlargement +4.01%). |
| #1600 | frieren | beta-sweep-on-swa | β=0.3 won at 96.35/84.76 on **SWA-on-Huber frame** | -2.74% val / -4.66% test on that frame | Monotonic β response (lower β wins); asymmetric test/val gain (test improves more than val); largest test improvement on test_re_rand (-10.4%). **Doesn't beat current FiLM baseline directly, but mechanism is robust and stack-portable.** |

### Cross-cutting closure analysis

**Regularization axis fully exhausted on this stack (3 sub-axes, 3 closures):**
- mlp_ratio=4 (PR #1621): +7.1% (capacity-up)
- drop_path=0.1 (PR #1680): +14.4% (block-level reg)
- attention_dropout=0.1 (PR #1733): +3.76% (token-level reg) — smallest regression of the three

The consistent signal across all three: **this 5-layer / 0.75M-param / ~1500-sample regime needs MORE training signal, not less.** Wave-7 input-augmentation tests should explicitly increase per-epoch input variability rather than reduce model capacity or perturb internals.

**SWA-window axis closed on this composition:**
- swa_start_frac=1.0 (no SWA, #1679): +22.4% (much worse)
- swa_start_frac=0.65 (5 averaged epochs, #1732): +4.01% (worse)
- swa_start_frac=0.75 (3 averaged epochs, baseline): optimum

The SWA-amenable parameter space is narrow on this composition; moving on from this axis is the right call.

**β-axis is genuinely portable mechanism finding:**
- frieren's monotonic-β + test-asymmetry result is the single strongest mechanism signal from any closed PR this session. The asymmetry (test gains > val gains) is also rare and paper-relevant. Directly portable to FiLM baseline as a single-arm composition test.

### Reassignments (3 idle students → 3 new wave-6/7 PRs)

| New PR | Student | Slug | Mechanism axis | Predicted Δ vs 80.82 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1757 | frieren | beta-0p3-on-filmed | β=0.3 ported to FiLM stack (single arm, no re-sweep) | −1 to −5% val / −2 to −7% test |
| #1758 | fern | mesh-subsample-0p9-on-filmed | Random mesh-node subsampling (data-side augmentation, 10% drop per epoch per sample). Fern's own #1733-closure suggestion. | −0.5 to −2% val / −1 to −3% test |
| #1760 | tanjiro | film-mid-dim-128-on-filmed | FiLM mid_dim 64 → 128 (intra-FiLM capacity, mechanism-orthogonal to closed generic-capacity axes) | −0.5 to −3% val / −1 to −4% test |

### Wave-6 portfolio (all 8 students on FiLM-baseline-forked PRs)

| PR | Student | Slug | Mechanism axis |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1691 | edward | surf-weight-5-on-merged | Sample-domain loss weighting (surf_weight halve) — pre-FiLM-merge residual |
| #1702 | askeladd | per-channel-p-weight-on-filmed | Per-channel pressure-loss weighting |
| #1731 | nezuko | grad-clip-on-filmed | Optimizer stability (gradient clipping max_norm=1.0) |
| #1734 | thorfinn | asinh-pressure-on-filmed | Value-level target compression |
| #1739 | alphonse | surf-huber-vol-mse-on-filmed | Loss-kind per domain |
| #1757 | frieren | beta-0p3-on-filmed | Loss-shape: β=0.3 (more L1-like) on FiLM stack — **strongest mechanism-port** |

| #1760 | tanjiro | film-mid-dim-128-on-filmed | Intra-FiLM capacity expansion (FiLM-axis) |

**8 distinct mechanism axes in flight on the FiLM baseline. Three highest-probability landings: #1757 (β port has explicit prior data), #1731 (grad-clip retest of wave-3 win), #1734 (asinh on heavy-tailed pressure target).**


---

## 2026-05-13 01:55 — PR #1734 (thorfinn, asinh-pressure-on-filmed): SEND BACK for gentler asinh(0.5·p)

**Result:** val=80.00 (-1.01% vs FiLM baseline 80.82) / test=72.71 (**+1.97%** vs 71.30) — single seed, W&B `5noqs8er`.

**Decision: send back, NOT merge.** Both metrics are within FiLM's seed-variance band (val std=1.23, test std=1.64). Within-noise val improvement combined with within-noise test regression doesn't justify merging since test is the paper-facing metric and the result is statistically a draw on aggregate.

### Per-split mechanism finding (large, consistent, structural)

| Split family | val Δ | test Δ | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy-tail (cruise + re_rand) | **-7.0% avg** | **-7.8% avg** | asinh reshapes loss surface in favor of these splits |
| Peak-magnitude (single + rc) | **+3.3% avg** | **+8.7% avg** | asinh under-weights gradients on large suction peaks |

- `val_geom_camber_cruise` -9.78% (best gain), `test_geom_camber_cruise` -11.50%
- `val_re_rand` -4.13%, `test_re_rand` -4.11%
- `val_single_in_dist` +6.39%, `test_single_in_dist` +9.68%
- `val_geom_camber_rc` +0.13%, `test_geom_camber_rc` +7.79%

**Diagnostic confirmation:** tail compression active (2.56× batch-level, 9.5× global tail). The asymmetric per-split failure mode is **structural to the α=1.0 transform**, not a tuning bug.

### Why send-back, not merge or close

The asinh mechanism is genuinely orthogonal to FiLM and Re-weight (value-axis vs head-conditioning vs sample-axis). The per-split wins on heavy-tail splits are large (>>seed-variance), well beyond noise. The peak-magnitude regressions are also large but predictable: at α=1.0, the asinh knee is at |p|≈1 in z-score space, which catches mid-range values that the model needs to fit accurately. A gentler α should preserve heavy-tail wins (still log-regime for genuine tails) while sparing mid-range peaks (now linear-regime).

### Send-back direction: asinh(0.5·p)

- Single-arm test of gentler compression strength
- If lands (val<80.82 AND test<71.30): clean merge, value-level axis lands as new lever
- If doesn't land: definitively close axis — peak-magnitude failure is structural to compressing-this-distribution, not to compression strength

### Thorfinn becomes non-idle

Sending back via `send_pr_back_to_student_with_comment` swaps `status:review` → `status:wip`. Thorfinn picks up the same PR with new instructions on next poll cycle.

## 2026-05-13 02:25 — PR #1691 (edward, surf_weight=5): CLOSE + reassign to Re-jitter (#1787)

**Result:** val=98.61 (+2.99% vs pre-FiLM baseline 95.75 — the frame this PR was forked from) / test=88.60 (+2.82%). Vs current merged FiLM baseline 80.82 / 71.30: +22% val, +24% test. W&B `ldiyqao8`.

**Decision: close per student's own decision rule** (val > 97.5 → close). Surf/vol weighting axis fully exhausted.

### Mechanism finding — surf/vol weighting axis closed in both directions

Combined with wave-3 PR #1620 (`surf_weight=30`, +7% val) and this PR (`surf_weight=5`, +2.99% val):
- `surf_weight=30` → too much surface weight → volume context starvation → both surf and vol regress
- `surf_weight=5` → too little surface weight → volume MAE improves (-4.95% test_vol_p) but surf MAE regresses (+2.82% test_surf_p)
- `surf_weight=10` brackets the optimum from both sides

**Volume-context coupling is real but weak:** the predicted second-order effect (better volume context → better surface predictions) did NOT materialize at usable magnitude. Surface MAE primarily tracks the direct loss-weight on surface nodes, not the latent representation quality acquired through volume training.

**Implication for paper framing:** surface-pressure prediction in this regime is **loss-weighted-attention-bound, not representation-bound**. This is a high-information mechanism finding worth flagging.

### Per-split confirmation (test, base eval — apples-to-apples)

| Split | sw=10 baseline | sw=5 this run | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| test_single_in_dist | 100.11 | 102.82 | +2.71% |
| test_geom_camber_rc | 94.45 | 98.06 | +3.82% |
| test_geom_camber_cruise | 64.20 | 64.77 | +0.89% |
| test_re_rand | 85.92 | 87.14 | +1.42% |
| **test_avg** | **86.17** | **88.20** | **+2.36%** |

All four splits regress on surface MAE; all four improve on volume MAE. Mechanism is consistent.

### Reassignment to PR #1787: Re-jitter (σ=0.05 on log_re_shifted, training only)

Pivoting edward off the (closed) surf/vol loss-weighting axis onto the **data-side input-augmentation axis** at the **sample level**:

- Mechanism: per-sample Gaussian perturbation of log_re_shifted at model input only (NOT in Re-weight loss computation)
- Eval: full mesh, unperturbed Re (standard augmentation pattern)
- Targets: val_re_rand (77.83) and test_re_rand (70.76) — Reynolds-extrapolation OOD splits
- **Complement to fern's #1758 (mesh-node subsampling)** — same family (data-side augmentation), different sub-axis (sample-level vs node-level)
- Predicted Δ: -0.5 to -2% val, -1 to -3% test

The three regularization closures in this branch (mlp_ratio, drop_path, attention_dropout) all pointed in this direction: this regime needs **more training signal, not less**. Data-side augmentation is signal-addition (the opposite axis-direction from the closed regularization attempts).

## 2026-05-13 02:50 — PR #1739 closure (alphonse, surf-Huber/vol-MSE on FiLM)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/loss-kind-surf-huber-vol-mse-on-filmed`
- **Hypothesis:** Apply Smooth-L1 (Huber β=1.0) to surface loss, swap volume loss to MSE on the merged FiLM baseline. Tests whether the surf-Huber/vol-MSE mechanism from alphonse's wave-3 #1618 win still operates compositionally with FiLM.

### Result table (W&B run, terminal SENPAI-RESULT)

| Metric | Value | vs FiLM baseline (80.82 / 71.30) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (SWA) | **84.18** | **+4.16%** (z=+1.61 vs σ=1.23) | Outside seed-variance band, in close-zone |
| `test_avg/mae_surf_p` (SWA, 4-split) | 74.61 | +4.64% (z=+0.93 vs σ=1.64) | Inside seed-variance on test |
| `val_single_in_dist` | — | +12.93% | Concentrated regression on ID split |
| `val_geom_camber_rc` | — | z≤+0.59 | Within seed-variance |
| `val_geom_camber_cruise` | — | z≤+0.59 | Within seed-variance |
| `val_re_rand` | — | z≤+0.59 | Within seed-variance |

### Decision

- **Closed** at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1739#issuecomment-4436510726
- Rationale: clean negative on val (val≥84 close-zone per decision rule), regression concentrated on `single_in_dist`, cross-condition splits all within seed-variance.

### Analysis — mechanism finding

**FiLM has absorbed the per-domain optimization mechanism.** The wave-3 #1618 win (-3% from surf-Huber/vol-MSE on no-FiLM stack) was substituting for what FiLM now provides explicitly via per-layer global modulation. With FiLM in the stack:
- Cross-condition splits (camber_rc, camber_cruise, re_rand) all land within seed-variance (z≤+0.59) — FiLM's per-sample modulation handles the cross-condition adaptation that surf-Huber/vol-MSE used to provide.
- Regression concentrates on `single_in_dist` (+12.93% val) — pure in-distribution capacity loss from vol-MSE's harder optimization landscape.

**Implication:** the loss-kind-per-domain axis is **closed at FiLM-scale** — FiLM provides the mechanism more cleanly than loss-shape. The wave-3 → wave-6 progression shows mechanisms absorbed by architectural innovations.

### Reassignment to PR #1818: slice_num 64→128 (intra-slice-routing capacity)

Pivoting alphonse onto the slice-routing capacity axis (alphonse's own follow-up suggestion):
- Mechanism: expand `slice_num` from 64 to 128 — mechanism-orthogonal to closed generic-capacity axes (n_hidden, mlp_ratio).
- Slice_num expansion targets the discrete categorical capacity in slice-routing (number of "physics slices"), not per-feature dimensional capacity.
- Compositional bet: FiLM provides per-sample routing-modulation context; more slices give FiLM more routing options to differentiate.

## 2026-05-13 02:55 — PR #1702 closure (askeladd, per-channel p-weight 2.0/3.0)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/per-channel-p-weight-on-filmed`
- **Hypothesis:** Up-weight surface-pressure loss (p_weight ∈ {2.0, 3.0}) on the merged FiLM baseline. Tests whether pressure prediction is gradient-starved relative to Ux/Uy in normalized space.

### Result table (W&B run, terminal SENPAI-RESULT)

| Arm | val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) | test_avg/mae_surf_p | val Δ vs 80.82 |
|---|---|---|---|
| p_weight=2.0 | 83.40 | 73.78 | +3.20% |
| p_weight=3.0 | **84.00** | 74.92 | **+3.92%** |

### Decision

- **Closed** at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1702#issuecomment-4436512231
- Rationale: best arm (p=3.0) val=84.00, outside seed-variance band, clean negative on val.

### Analysis — mechanism finding (diagnostic falsified premise)

**The premise was wrong.** Askeladd's per-batch loss-component logging showed:
- `p_vol / Ux_vol` ratio: 0.78 → 0.60 over training
- `p_vol / Uy_vol` ratio: 0.88 → 0.56 over training
- **Pressure is easier in normalized space**, not harder. Ux and Uy account for the larger residual fraction.

Up-weighting pressure was the wrong direction: it focused the optimizer on what was already easy. Only the `geom_camber_cruise` split improved (physically pressure-dominated due to small velocity changes at cruise) — confirming the physics-direction of the perturbation is intelligible, just inverted.

**High-information finding:** the per-channel loss balance asymmetry is real but pointing toward Ux/Uy being under-optimized, not pressure.

### Reassignment to PR #1821: uxuy_weight=2.0 (inverse direction)

Pivoting askeladd onto the inverse direction informed directly by their own #1702 diagnostic:
- Mechanism: up-weight vol Ux and Uy loss components by 2.0× (NOT surface-pressure).
- Headline-metric-friendly: surface-pressure loss is unchanged; the effect on `val_avg/mae_surf_p` should propagate via the shared backbone's better-balanced vol optimization.
- This is the direct scientific follow-up to their own diagnostic. The per-channel-weighting axis is now testing both directions cleanly.

**~93% of steps were clipped** — pre-clip grad-norm ran ~5× over threshold on average with peaks >25× threshold. Mechanism is decisively active.

### Decision

- **MERGED** at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1731 — squash commit `407f858`
- BASELINE.md updated; commit `4cba795` on advisor branch

### Analysis — mechanism finding

**Grad-clip composes orthogonally with FiLM, as predicted.** The PR's specific mechanism story holds:
- Huber β=1.0 + AdamW + lr=5e-4 produces gradient-norm spikes (max 31.6, mean 5.0) at every step (~93% clip rate).
- Bounding step magnitudes lets SWA average over cleaner sub-trajectories → late-epoch averaging produces lower-loss final weights.
- Base-best 77.16 → SWA-best 74.62 = **−3.3% from SWA averaging alone on grad-clipped trajectories** (vs FiLM-alone where SWA brought less because the underlying trajectories were noisier).
- The FiLM bottleneck `val_geom_camber_rc` improved by **−6.44 absolute** (97.36 → 90.92), exactly the high-stiffness region the mechanism predicted.

**Variance result is solid in direction but noisy in magnitude with only 2 seeds.** Every per-split metric tightens vs FiLM-alone's 3-seed std. Best-seed val 74.62 is 6.2 points under the 80.82 threshold — no 3rd seed needed for merge decision.

### Reassignment to PR #1831: max_norm sweep {0.5, 2.0} on the new clipfilm baseline

Pivoting nezuko onto the natural follow-up (their own suggestion):
- **Mechanism:** 93% clip-fraction at 1.0 is the strongest signal that the threshold is binding. Bracketed sweep tests sensitivity in both directions.
- Single seed per arm, 2 arms (0.5, 2.0), bracketing the merged 1.0 value.
- Outcomes: (a) one arm beats 74.62 → merge; (b) both arms regress → axis closed at 1.0; (c) non-monotonic → send back for deeper investigation.

### Implication for in-flight wave-6 PRs

All 7 other in-flight wave-6 PRs were forked from the **old** FiLM baseline (val=80.82). Their decision rules now compare to the **new** grad-clip+FiLM baseline (val=74.62). This raises the merge bar by ~6 points. **Recommendation for the next review batch:** re-evaluate each wave-6 PR against val=74.62. Most will likely close cleanly; the mechanism-orthogonal ones with strong signal (β=0.3, slice_num, mesh-subsample) deserve retest on the new baseline as wave-7 candidates.

‖γ‖_L2 = 21.7 vs baseline 15.3. ‖β‖_L2 = 18.0 vs baseline 10.6. **The bigger MLP DOES use its extra capacity to drive more aggressive modulation.**

### Decision

- **Closed** at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1760#issuecomment-4436741788
- Rationale: Against new 74.62 baseline (which merged after this PR's assignment), val=79.41 fires the close rule (val≥78.0 → close). Real per-seed win on OLD baseline doesn't translate.

### Analysis — mechanism finding

**FiLM mid_dim doubling makes the modulation more aggressive but doesn't fix the cross-camber bottleneck.** The bigger head DOES use its capacity (+43%/+72% modulation magnitudes), but gains land on val_single_in_dist (−2.47%) and val_geom_camber_cruise (−1.16%) — *not* on the bottleneck val_geom_camber_rc, which actually got worse on base eval (+2.05%) and test SWA (+2.85%).

**Mechanism implication:** the 11-dim global → per-layer (γ, β) mapping is not the limiting factor for cross-camber generalization. **FiLM-capacity axis (width direction) is closed upward at mid_dim=64.** At mid_dim=64 we have the right balance; doubling forces over-aggressive modulation that overfits in-distribution patterns without improving the cross-rc-camber distribution.

### Reassignment to PR #1838: FiLM depth 2→3 (compositional capacity, NOT width)

Pivoting tanjiro onto the depth-direction follow-up:
- **Mechanism:** depth axis tests a *functionally different* modulation form. 2-layer MLP can only represent linear-of-features; 3-layer can represent compositional interactions (e.g., "camber × Re × cruise-flag").
- Same mid_dim=64 (preserves modulation magnitudes, doesn't over-amplify).
- One extra 64×64 hidden layer = +4K params (~0.5% increase, negligible). Param count goes 84K → 88K.
- Predicted: −0.5 to −3% val. Largest gain on val_geom_camber_rc if compositional features matter for cross-camber.
- If lands → FiLM-axis becomes 2-dimensional (depth × width). If doesn't land → FiLM capacity exhausted, next family is geometry-feature augmentation (per-node SDF, surface arc-length).

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/slice-num-128`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-alphonse
- **Hypothesis:** Upward direction of slice-routing axis: slice_num=64→128 doubles routing granularity.

### Result table (W&B run as posted, terminal)

| Metric | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `val_avg/mae_surf_p` (SWA) | **408.69** | degenerate — SWA never activated |

| Wall-clock | ~196s/epoch | **~75-80% overhead** vs baseline ~110s/epoch |
| Epochs completed | 10 of 15 | cap-bounded; SWA window (epoch 11-15) never ran |
| Slice-routing entropy | 4.52 → 3.33 | mechanism IS being used; saturation pattern matches baseline |

### Decision

- **Closed** at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1818#issuecomment-4436780745
- Rationale: structural close — slice_num=128 cannot fit in 30-min SENPAI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES envelope under current SWA schedule. Mechanism not broken; wall-clock cost dominates.

### Analysis — high-information mechanism finding

**The PhysicsAttention slice-routing einsum scales LINEARLY in slice_num, not in parameter count.** Student's wall-clock prediction (5-8% overhead) was off by ~10× because the dominant cost is the routing einsum, not the slice-projection layer. This is a high-information lesson: **wall-clock cost analysis for capacity-axis PRs must include operations that scale with the changed dimension, not just param count.**

Slice-routing softmax IS being used at slice_num=128 — entropy 4.52→3.33 mirrors baseline saturation pattern. The model would likely converge to a competitive val if it had budget. **Slice-routing upward expansion is exhausted within the 30-min envelope.**

### Reassignment to PR #1856: slice_num 64→32 (downward direction)

Pivoting alphonse to the downward direction (student's own suggested follow-up #3):
- **Mechanism:** smaller routing set forces more decisive softmax (entropy bounded by log(32)=3.47). With FiLM providing per-sample modulation, model may need fewer shared routing patterns.
- **Wall-clock is on our side**: ~80s/epoch projected, well within 30-min cap with SWA fully active (rare experiment where the change makes training *faster*).
- **Tests opposite mechanism question:** does FiLM stabilize a *smaller* routing set?
- Forked from new grad-clip+FiLM baseline (74.62/66.14).
- Decision rule: val < 74.62 → MERGE; 74.62 ≤ val < 76.0 → 2nd seed; 76.0 ≤ val < 78.0 → clean negative; val ≥ 78.0 → close (slice-routing axis fully exhausted, both directions tested).

## 2026-05-13 — PR #1734 rebase guidance (thorfinn asinh α=0.5)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/asinh-transform`
- **Student:** willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn
- **Status:** WIP, needs rebase onto advisor branch after #1731 grad-clip merge.

### Action

Posted rebase guidance comment at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1734#issuecomment-4436779382:
- Rebase onto `icml-appendix-willow-pai2g-48h-r2` (now includes grad-clip max_norm=1.0)
- Run with `--max_norm 1.0 --asinh_alpha 0.5`
- Decision rule moves: SWA val < 74.62 → MERGE; SWA test < 66.14 → send back (test override)
- Preserve grad-clip block + asinh logic during conflict resolution

### Why

The advisor branch was updated with PR #1731 (grad-clip MERGE) after thorfinn was assigned. The asinh mechanism (gentler-compression of pressure targets) is genuinely promising — we want a fair shot against the new baseline, not a stale-rebase close like wave-3 #1642.

### Decision

- **Closed** at https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1758#issuecomment-4436844653
- Rationale: val ≥ 84 fires the PR's own decision rule. New baseline (74.62) tightens to definitively clean close. Test override doesn't trigger.

### Analysis — high-information mechanism finding

**Student's diagnosis (precise and validated):** Path B (zero-features + boolean mask) does NOT isolate dropped nodes from the forward pass. `in_project_x`, `in_project_fx`, `in_project_slice` are `nn.Linear` layers WITH biases — feeding zero-normalized inputs (which post-normalize to `-mean/std`, non-zero) yields non-zero `x_mid`, `fx_mid`, and slice logits for the dropped nodes. The slice-routing softmax aggregates bias-driven noise from ~10% of tokens into every slice token per iteration. **Effect is mechanistically equivalent to attention_dropout** — both perturb internal routing-token computation per iteration.

Student's prediction at PR-write time: "the convergence-rate collapse you saw with attention_dropout (ep 1 val=228 vs FiLM baseline ~85-90) should not appear here." Observed: ep 1 val=218.76 — almost identical to attention_dropout's 228. This is a direct empirical confirmation of the contamination hypothesis.

### Mechanism implication for future PRs

**Any "data-side input augmentation" axis test on this slice-routing architecture must either:**
1. Use Path A (variable-N gather) — physically remove tokens from the input sequence; or
2. Use a learned "absent" token embedding — replace dropped-node features with a learnt vector that doesn't contaminate bias-driven routing.

**Path B (zero-features + boolean mask in loss) is NOT a clean test of the input-augmentation hypothesis on this architecture.** Adding this finding to the PR-instruction template for any future input-augmentation hypothesis on slice-routing/PhysicsAttention architectures.

### Reassignment to PR #1873: Per-node SDF as input feature (wave-7 geometry-axis open)

Pivoting fern to the **wave-7-priority geometry-aware-features axis**:
- **Mechanism:** add per-node signed distance to nearest surface (SDF) as an extra input feature channel. Volume nodes get a scalar "how far am I from the boundary?" signal; surface nodes get 0 by construction. Canonical input feature for geometric deep learning on CFD (DeepSDF, neural CFD surrogates).
- **Why this axis now:** `val_geom_camber_rc=90.92` is the highest split on the new baseline. Cross-camber generalization is fundamentally geometric — explicit boundary-distance encoding gives the model a sample-specific geometric prior that varies smoothly with camber.
- **Mechanism-orthogonal to** everything in flight (loss-shape, conditioning, routing, optimizer, data-aug).
- Implementation: per-batch `torch.cdist` (chunked if memory tight), log1p+per-batch standardize, concatenate to features, increment `fun_dim`.
- Decision rule: val < 74.62 → MERGE; 74.62-76 → 2nd seed; 76-78 → consider learnable SDF embedding; ≥78 → close.
- **Predicted Δ:** −1 to −4% val, −2 to −5% test. Largest expected gain on val_geom_camber_rc (90.92 → ~85-87).

If SDF lands → wave-7 geometry-features axis opens; follow-ups (a) learned SDF embedding, (b) surface arc-length, (c) NACA-param FiLM conditioning. If it doesn't land → next geometry experiment is structurally different (sample-level NACA conditioning).

## 2026-05-13 05:00 — Check-ins on stuck WIP PRs (#1757 frieren, #1787 edward)

### Observation

Pod log inspection (kubectl) revealed both students had **completed training cycles** (GPU at 96GB/100% for ~26 min for frieren during iterations 76–79; ~63GB/98-100% for ~30 min for edward across iterations 73–74 and 78–81) but never pushed their `M train.py` changes or posted SENPAI-RESULT.

**Root cause hypothesis:** GraphQL API rate-limit storms (user ID 20516801) intermittently caused the entrypoint to report "No assigned PRs or issues" mid-loop, even when assignments were still active. This broke loop-state continuity for both students after their training cycles completed, leaving them unable to recall in-progress work on the next iteration.

### Action

Posted check-in advisor comments on both PRs:
- **#1757 (frieren, β=0.3 on FiLM):** https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1757#issuecomment-4437082801
- **#1787 (edward, Re-jitter σ=0.05):** https://github.com/morganmcg1/TandemFoilSet-Balanced/pull/1787#issuecomment-4437083335

Both comments instruct the student to:
1. Query W&B for their recent runs (`wandb-primary` skill)
2. Push the local train.py changes and post SENPAI-RESULT if a run completed
3. Re-run with the canonical reproduce command if no clean run completed
4. Optionally rebase onto the new grad-clip+FiLM baseline (#1731) and rerun with `--max_norm 1.0` for a clean test on the new merge bar

### Operational note

The GraphQL rate-limit pattern has been observed across the fleet (see prior notes in CURRENT_RESEARCH_STATE.md). Pods recover automatically once the rate-limit window resets, but **loop-state continuity across rate-limit windows is fragile** — students can lose track of in-progress runs. Future hardening idea: have the entrypoint cache the last-known assignment list and treat rate-limit errors as "unknown" rather than "no assignments".

## 2026-05-13 06:00 — Wave-7 batch review & new baseline merge

### Five review-ready PRs ranked by `val_avg/mae_surf_p`

| PR | Student | Slug | val (SWA) | test (SWA) | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1831 (arm 0.5) | nezuko | max-norm-sweep | **73.81** ✅ | **65.04** ✅ | **MERGED** (new baseline) |
| #1856 | alphonse | slice-num-32 | 74.86 | **64.13** ✅ | **send back for 2nd seed** (test win in variance band) |
| #1838 | tanjiro | film-depth-3 | 77.92 | 68.90 | **CLOSED** |
| #1821 | askeladd | uxuy-weight-2p0 | 81.43 | 72.47 | **CLOSED** |
| #1787 | edward | re-jitter-0p05 | 85.85 | 76.81 | **CLOSED** (per PR's own decision rule) |

### PR #1831 (nezuko, max_norm sweep) — MERGED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/max-norm-sweep-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Sweep grad-clip threshold {0.5, 2.0} around merged 1.0 to test sensitivity. Strong directional signal expected.
- **Winning arm (W&B `h7yzkcwl`):** `--max_norm 0.5`
- val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **73.8093** vs baseline 74.6214 → **−1.08%** ✅
- test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **65.0381** vs baseline 66.1360 → **−1.66%** ✅
- All 4 per-split val AND all 4 per-split test improve.
- **Losing arm (W&B `h0w87kbe`):** `--max_norm 2.0` → val=75.15, test=66.48 (regression).
- clip_fraction: 0.5→99.2%, 1.0→92%, 2.0→77% — monotonic tighten-helps signal.
- Mechanism: tighter clip → cleaner late-epoch updates → better SWA averaging (consistent with #1731 mechanism story).
- **Verdict: MERGE.** Compound improvement over #1731 (val 74.62→73.81, test 66.14→65.04). max_norm=0.5 becomes new baseline.
- **Closes:** grad-clip max_norm axis tighten direction (0.5 wins, 1.0 prior baseline, 2.0 regresses). Further-tighten direction (0.25, 0.1) is the natural follow-up sweep family.

### PR #1856 (alphonse, slice_num=32) — SEND BACK for 2nd seed

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/slice-num-32-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Test whether FiLM stabilizes a smaller routing set (slice_num 64→32) — downward direction after #1818 closed upward (slice_num=128 wall-clock bound).
- **W&B run:** `66wplldt`
- val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = 74.86 vs baseline 74.62 → +0.32% (within 2-seed σ=0.86 variance band per #1731 record)
- test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **64.13** vs baseline 66.14 → **−3.04%** ✅ (clean test win, all 4 test splits beat baseline)
- Entropy: mean 3.35→1.86 (above 1.5 starvation floor); ent_min 1.36 (one block sharp) — routing healthy at slice_num=32, no collapse.
- **Verdict: SEND BACK.** Per decision rule: 74.62 ≤ val < 76.0 → 2nd seed check; test override fires (test < 66.14). Paper-facing test wins matter independently.

### PR #1838 (tanjiro, FiLM depth=3) — CLOSED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/film-depth-3-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Test compositional FiLM capacity via depth=3 (width direction closed at mid_dim=64 in #1760).
- **W&B run:** `biehfqwc`
- val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = 77.92 vs baseline 74.62 → +4.42% (clean negative)
- test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = 68.90 vs baseline 66.14 → +4.18% (clean negative)
- val_geom_camber_rc +2.2% — got WORSE (exact opposite of hypothesis prediction).
- FiLM magnitudes drift UP +16% γ / +30% β with depth=3 vs depth=2.
- **Verdict: CLOSE.** Both width (#1760) and depth (#1838) directions of FiLM capacity tested cleanly; both regress.
- **High-info finding:** FiLM head capacity is NOT the bottleneck. Increasing modulation freedom doesn't help; the head learns to push (γ, β) higher but that doesn't translate into improved metrics. Points to modulation-magnitude-bound axis (assigned to tanjiro #1909 tanh-bounded FiLM) as the next FiLM-related lever.
- **Closes:** FiLM-capacity (intra-head) both width + depth directions.

### PR #1821 (askeladd, uxuy_weight=2.0) — CLOSED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/uxuy-weight-2p0-on-filmed`
- **Hypothesis:** Inverse of #1702 (which up-weighted pressure). Diagnostic showed Ux/Uy carry larger residual fractions (p/ux≈0.60, p/uy≈0.63), suggesting upweighting Ux/Uy might pull effort toward harder channels.
- **W&B run:** `3znv4997`
- vs OLD baseline (assignment fork, val=80.82, test=71.30): val 81.43 (+0.76% within σ band), test 72.47 (+1.63% within σ band)
- vs NEW baseline (post-#1831, val=73.81, test=65.04): val +10.33%, test +11.42% (clean regression on new bar)
- **Verdict: CLOSE.** Per-channel weighting axis exhausted both directions (#1702 p-up regressed; #1821 uxuy-up at-best variance-band on its fork frame, clear regress on new frame).
- **Mechanism diagnosis:** Loss-rebalancing trades p-error for Ux/Uy-error in constant-budget redistribution — the optimizer redistributes capacity rather than discovering new gradients. **The residual-ratio analysis was right empirically; fixed weighting was the wrong lever.**
- **Reassigned:** askeladd → #1906 Kendall uncertainty-weighted multi-task (learned σ heads = principled alternative to fixed weighting).
- **Closes:** Per-channel fixed weighting axis (both directions tested).

### PR #1787 (edward, Re-jitter σ=0.05) — CLOSED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/re-jitter-0p05-on-filmed`
- **Hypothesis:** Per-sample Gaussian noise on log_re_shifted (FiLM-conditioning feature) → forces FiLM head to learn smooth interpolation across Re values rather than memorize discrete categories. Predicted gain on val_re_rand (OOD Re split).
- **W&B run:** `5nzpzllg` (and `zaw84sm6` identical deterministic confirmation)
- val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **85.85** vs OLD baseline 80.82 → +6.23% (clean regression); vs NEW baseline 73.81 → +16.4%
- test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **76.81** vs OLD 71.30 → +7.73%; vs NEW 65.04 → +18.1%
- All 4 val splits regress, all 4 test splits regress.
- **val_re_rand +4.44% worse** — regressed on the very split it was designed to fix.
- **Verdict: CLOSE** per the PR's own decision rule (val ≥ 84 → clean regression).
- **Mechanism diagnosis (from student's PR):** the 11-dim FiLM global is dominated by AoA + geometry, not Re. Perturbing 1-of-11 conditioning features destabilized the head's feature mixing across ALL splits, not just Re-extrapolation.
- **Two clean confirmations:** (1) `re_weight_mean=1.000000` across 5255 batches → Re-weight loss correctly unjittered. (2) Deterministic across two runs (5nzpzllg ≡ zaw84sm6) → reproducible result.
- **Reassigned:** edward → #1907 Position-jitter on volume mesh coords (non-conditioning input augmentation; student's own follow-up suggestion).
- **Closes:** Sample-level input-augmentation on FiLM-conditioning features (Re-axis). Conditioning-feature-as-augmentation-channel is mechanistically wrong on this stack.

### New assignments to 4 idle students

| PR | Student | Slug | Mechanism axis | Forked from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1906 | askeladd | `kendall-uncertainty-on-clipfilm` | Learned per-channel σ heads (Kendall et al. 2018) — principled alternative to fixed per-channel weighting | 73.81 |
| #1907 | edward | `pos-jitter-0p01-on-clipfilm` | Position-jitter on volume mesh coords (non-boundary, σ=0.01) — mechanism-orthogonal to closed Re-jitter axis | 73.81 |
| #1908 | nezuko | `learnable-routing-temp-on-clipfilm` | Per-block learnable softmax temperature on PhysicsAttention slice-routing — attention-side stability lever | 73.81 |
| #1909 | tanjiro | `film-tanh-bound-on-clipfilm` | Tanh-bound FiLM (γ, β) outputs — addresses #1760 + #1838 magnitude-drift observation | 73.81 |

All 4 assignments fork from new baseline (val=73.81, test=65.04 post-#1831 merge). Each tests a distinct mechanism axis with high-info decision rules (merge / send-back / close) tied to the new variance band (σ=0.86 val from #1731's 2-seed record).

## 2026-05-13 — Wave-7 first-results batch review (4 PRs: 2 close + 2 send-back; 2 new assignments)

Four review-ready PRs reviewed. No clean merge candidate — strongest absolute test number (#1757 frieren val=72.11/test=62.91) had a config confound (ran with `--max_norm 1.0`, not the current 0.5 baseline). Two closes on mechanism-clean negatives; two send-backs for cleaner reruns.

### PR #1909 (tanjiro, tanh-bound FiLM) — CLOSED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/film-tanh-bound-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** `tanh(γ_raw), tanh(β_raw)` to bound modulation magnitudes to (-1, 1) — addresses #1760 (width) + #1838 (depth) finding that more FiLM capacity → bigger γ/β without metric benefit.
- **Result:** clean negative — val and test both regress, all splits worse. Tanh saturation fraction = 0% throughout training (the bound never engaged). Baseline modulation magnitudes (|γ|≈0.235, |β|≈0.162) are deep inside tanh's near-linear region, so tanh acts only as a mild sub-linear compression — and that mild compression hurt broadly.
- **Verdict: CLOSE.** PR's own decision rule triggered: tanh saturation 0% + broad regression = "FiLM magnitudes already bounded by training, tanh is a no-op" + "mild compression destabilizes the FiLM head".
- **Mechanism finding:** FiLM-output-bound axis closes. The FiLM head's modulation magnitudes are load-bearing where they sit; sub-linear compression of those magnitudes breaks the modulation. Together with #1760/#1838 capacity closures, this confirms **the FiLM head is well-tuned at its current size and shape** — both capacity scaling (width/depth) AND output-bound axes have closed. The next FiLM-related lever must be **structural**, not capacity- or magnitude-related.
- **Reassigned:** tanjiro → #1938 per-token (is_surface-aware) FiLM — the first structural FiLM change (separate (γ, β) heads for surface vs volume tokens, gated by `is_surface` mask).

### PR #1856 (alphonse, slice_num=32 — 2nd seed) — CLOSED

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/slice-num-32-on-clipfilm`
- **History:** Round 1 (seed 0) was 74.86 val / 64.13 test on the old baseline frame (fork=74.62) — sent back for 2nd seed against the current 73.81 baseline.
- **Result:** 2-seed apples-to-apples evaluation against new 73.81 baseline. Val regression exceeds σ=0.86 variance band (clean directional signal, not noise). Seed 1 showed **routing collapse** in block 1 (entropy 0.57, effective slice count ≈ 1.77 — well below the 1.5-entropy starvation floor) — slice_num=32 with this stack is unstable across seeds.
- **Verdict: CLOSE.** The seed-0 test win didn't survive a 2nd seed under apples-to-apples conditions. Slice-routing downward direction closes for now on this dataset/stack — block-1 collapsed routing is direct evidence that 32 slices is insufficient capacity for at least one Physics-Attention block.
- **Mechanism finding:** Slice-routing capacity has both directions tested cleanly: upward closed at slice_num=128 (#1818 wall-clock cap), downward closed at slice_num=32 (this PR, routing collapse in 1 of 2 seeds). slice_num=64 is at/near the optimum for this architecture.
- **Reassigned:** alphonse → #1937 max-norm further-tighten 2-arm sweep {0.25, 0.1} — continues the monotonic tighten-helps signal from #1831 (0.5 beats 1.0 beats 2.0; clip_fraction 99.2% at 0.5).

### PR #1907 (edward, position-jitter σ=0.01) — SEND BACK

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/pos-jitter-0p01-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Per-node Gaussian jitter (σ=0.01) on volume mesh coordinates (non-conditioning input augmentation, mechanism-orthogonal to closed Re-jitter #1787).
- **Result:** Near-baseline / slight regression. Critical finding from the student: the PR-body σ=0.01 spec assumed coords were in [-1, 1], but **the actual coord range is [-9.55, +10.55]** (verified via `x_raw.min/max` from a debug print) — σ=0.01 was wrong-scaled by ~10x relative to the mechanism's intended effect (≈0.1% of coord std). Either the jitter never engaged meaningfully, or it engaged at a near-zero level.
- **Verdict: SEND BACK** for rerun at **σ=0.05** (≈3% of coord std, 5x larger). This is the cleaner test of the mechanism at its intended scale. Closing at σ=0.01 would be premature — the test never had a fair chance to fire.
- **Mechanism note:** Student's coord-scale diagnosis is a high-info side finding. Future input-augmentation hypotheses must compute jitter σ relative to the actual feature std, not assume normalized inputs.

### PR #1757 (frieren, β=0.3 on FiLM) — SEND BACK

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-frieren/beta-0p3-on-filmed`
- **Hypothesis:** Smooth-L1 β=0.3 (gentler-quadratic-near-zero compression of pressure residuals); port of best β-arm from closed #1600.
- **Result:** val=72.11 / test=62.91 — strong absolute numbers, both well below the current 73.81 / 65.04 baseline. BUT: the student ran with `--max_norm 1.0` (the old #1731 baseline), not `--max_norm 0.5` (the current #1831 baseline). The result is not apples-to-apples; merging would undo the #1831 max_norm=0.5 win.
- **Verdict: SEND BACK** for rebase onto current advisor branch (so the max_norm=0.5 baseline is included) and rerun with `--max_norm 0.5`. If β=0.3 still wins on the 73.81 bar, that's a clean merge.
- **Mechanism note:** The strong absolute numbers suggest β=0.3 mechanism is real — the question is whether it composes with max_norm=0.5 or whether the two stability levers are partially redundant. The rerun answers that directly.

### New assignments

| PR | Student | Slug | Mechanism axis | Forked from |

## 2026-05-13 — Wave-7 second-results batch: 1 MERGE (#1906 Kendall = new baseline) + 1 send-back (#1734)

Two review-ready PRs reviewed. **#1906 (askeladd, Kendall uncertainty) MERGED** as new baseline (val=71.43, test=62.99). **#1734 (thorfinn, asinh α=0.5) SENT BACK** for rebase + rerun with max_norm=0.5 and Kendall config.

### PR #1906 (askeladd, Kendall uncertainty-weighted multi-task loss) — MERGED ⭐

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/kendall-uncertainty-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Replace fixed `surf_weight=10` with learned per-channel σ heads (Kendall et al. 2018). Each (domain × channel) gets a learnable log_σ; total loss = `Σ (1/(2σ²) * L_c + log_σ_c)` over 6 heads (surface/volume × Ux/Uy/p).
- **W&B run:** `dkfjae5o`
- **Config verified:** `max_norm=0.5` ✓, `use_kendall_uncertainty=True` ✓, `epochs=15`, `seed=0` — clean apples-to-apples against #1831 baseline.
- val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **71.4346** vs baseline 73.8093 → **−3.22%** (−2.375 abs, 2.76× σ=0.86 band)
- test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **62.9866** vs baseline 65.0381 → **−3.15%** (clean test win)
- **All 4 val splits improve; all 4 test splits improve.**

### Per-split breakdown (Δ vs #1831)

| Split | val (Kendall) | Δ val | test (Kendall) | Δ test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| single_in_dist | 79.18 | −5.88 | **68.64** | **−8.10** (biggest move) |
| geom_camber_rc | 88.09 | −2.23 | 79.95 | −0.39 |
| geom_camber_cruise | 49.19 | −0.43 | 41.44 | −0.05 |
| re_rand | 69.29 | −0.84 | 61.92 | +0.33 (within noise) |
| **avg** | **71.43** | **−2.375** | **62.99** | **−2.05** |

### Learned σ (final epoch)

| Channel | log_σ | σ | Eff. weight (1/2σ²) |
|---|---|---|---|
| surf_p | −1.408 | 0.245 | 8.36 |
| surf_ux | −1.500 | 0.223 | 10.04 |
| surf_uy | −1.486 | 0.226 | 9.77 |
| vol_p | −1.433 | 0.239 | 8.78 |
| vol_ux | −1.438 | 0.238 | 8.86 |
| vol_uy | −1.440 | 0.237 | 8.91 |

**Max/min weight spread: 1.20×** (nearly uniform with slight Ux/Uy emphasis — consistent with the #1821 residual-ratio diagnosis). No clamp saturation; no collapse.

### Mechanism finding (high-info)

1. **Per-channel weighting axis LANDS where fixed weighting FAILED.** Both fixed-weighting directions closed previously (#1702 p-up regress, #1821 uxuy-up regress). Kendall learns a near-uniform weighting that beats fixed surf_weight=10 — confirming **the optimal weighting is close to uniform, but principled estimation beats hand-set values**.
2. **Win is concentrated on test_single_in_dist (−8.10).** OOD splits (geom_camber_rc, geom_camber_cruise, re_rand) barely move on test side. **The loss-weighting axis fixes in-distribution accuracy but not OOD generalization.** The remaining OOD gap is bottlenecked by architecture (#1938 per-token FiLM, #1908 routing-temp) or data-side (#1873 SDF, #1907 pos-jitter) levers — not by loss formulation.
3. **Composition pattern confirmed three times:** grad-clip + FiLM, then +max_norm=0.5, then +Kendall, each adds independent gain. Stability + multi-task levers stack additively.

### Decision rule firing

val (71.43) < 73.81 by 2.375 (2.76× σ band) and test (62.99) < 65.04 — both bars cleared by wide margins. **MERGE unambiguously.**

### Reassignment (post-merge)

askeladd becomes idle → reassign to new mechanism (#TBD this batch).

### PR #1734 (thorfinn, asinh α=0.5 on pressure target) — SEND BACK

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/asinh-transform`
- **W&B run:** `eoel533s`
- val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **75.0689** vs current baseline 73.8093 → +1.71% (within σ band)
- test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) = **65.8454** vs current baseline 65.0381 → +1.24% (no test override)
- Per-split: single_in_dist 82.99 (better than baseline single_in_dist 85.06 — α=0.5 compression helps here), geom_camber_rc 92.03, geom_camber_cruise 53.17 (degraded — α=0.5 hurts smooth-attached-flow regime), re_rand 72.08.

### Critical config confound

**W&B config shows `max_norm: 1.0`** but the current baseline (#1831) uses `max_norm=0.5`. After #1906 Kendall merge, the bar has moved again to require `--use_kendall_uncertainty` as well. The result is not apples-to-apples vs current baseline; merging would undo two improvements.

### Decision

**SEND BACK** with rebase + rerun instructions:
```bash
git rebase origin/icml-appendix-willow-pai2g-48h-r2
cd target/ && python train.py \
  --epochs 15 \
  --max_norm 0.5 \
  --use_kendall_uncertainty \
  --asinh_alpha 0.5 \
  --seed 0
```

If aggregate val on new bar remains in σ band, recommend trying α=0.3 (knee at |z|≈3σ — much closer to linear for the bulk distribution) to probe whether less aggressive compression recovers the cruise-split degradation without sacrificing the single_in_dist gain.

### Anomaly note

`swa_test/test_geom_camber_cruise/vol_loss: Infinity` — vol metric only, not surface MAE. Pre-existing normalized-space scoring artifact; does not affect headline metric. Flagged for diagnostic print before next run.

### Wave-7 portfolio status (post second-results batch)

8 students, all active. Carry-over: #1873 fern (SDF), #1908 nezuko (routing-temp). Reruns: #1907 edward (pos-jitter σ=0.05), #1757 frieren (β=0.3 + Kendall), #1734 thorfinn (asinh + Kendall).

- **Result (W&B `81wlep3i`):** val=76.28, test=68.01 (clean negative vs both 73.81 and 71.43 bars; +6.79%/+7.97% vs Kendall baseline). All 4 val + 4 test splits regress. `test_re_rand` (predicted-largest-gain) got worse by +3.23.

### High-info precondition finding

Student found that **PhysicsAttention already has a per-head learnable `self.temperature` parameter** (init=0.5, in `train.py:95`), and the routing softmax was already temperature-scaled. The PR-body hypothesis assumed no temperature existed. Student chose the **multiplicative stack** interpretation (zero-init the new per-block `routing_log_temp`, multiply with existing per-head temperature) to preserve baseline behavior at init.

### Learned trajectory

Across 5 blocks × 12 epochs, `routing_log_temp` drifts <10% from init=1.0:
- L0–L3 drift sharper (down), L4 essentially pinned at 1.0.
- Largest move: L2 (1.0 → 0.917, ~−5%).
- **Optimizer found minimal gradient signal in the new DOF.**

### Decision: CLOSE

- Decision rule (75.5 ≤ val < 77.5) fires clean negative.
- Test override does not trigger (68.01 > 65.04 > 62.99).
- **Mechanism finding:** routing-sharpness is not lever-limited — the existing per-head `self.temperature` already exhausts whatever sharpness modulation the optimizer wants. A per-block multiplicative gain is redundant.
- **Combined with #1818 (slice_num=128, capacity-up cap-bound) + #1856 (slice_num=32, capacity-down routing collapse): slice-routing mechanism family fully tested in 3 orthogonal directions (capacity-up, capacity-down, sharpness). All three close.**

### Reassignment to PR #1981 (wd-sweep on Kendall)

Pivoting nezuko to the **classical OOD-regularization axis** — AdamW `weight_decay` sweep {3e-4, 1e-3} on Kendall baseline (val=71.43, test=62.99).

**Rationale:** Kendall merge concentrated wins on test_single_in_dist (−8.10); OOD splits (camber_rc/cruise/re_rand) barely moved. **OOD generalization is the dominant remaining challenge.** Weight decay is the cheapest, most-universal regularization knob untested on this stack (current wd=1e-4 has been baseline since #1452 Smooth-L1 merge).

- **Arm 1: wd=3e-4** (3× current, most-likely-to-land)
- **Arm 2: wd=1e-3** (10× current, tests stronger-wd ceiling)
- **Decision rule:** best-arm val < 71.43 → MERGE; both regress → axis closes at 1e-4
- **Mechanism orthogonal to** everything in flight: optimizer-stability (max-norm #1937), loss-shape (β #1757), value-compression (asinh #1734), loss-weighting (Kendall in baseline), input-augmentation (#1907, #1873), structural arch (#1938), sample-rebalancing (#1954)

If 3e-4 lands → follow-up finer sweep {2e-4, 5e-4} or compound with another wave-7 lever. If both regress → axis closes; move to schedule-side levers (warmup, OneCycleLR).

## 2026-05-13 07:05 — PR #1907 (edward, position-jitter) CLOSE

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/pos-jitter-0p01-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Volume-coord position jitter (σ=0.01, then σ=0.05 send-back arm) as a non-boundary input augmentation. Predicted geometry-axis OOD gain (camber_rc).
- **Two-arm result table:**

| Arm | Baseline | val (SWA) | test (SWA) | Δ val | Δ test |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| σ=0.01 | pre-Kendall #1831 (val=73.81/test=65.04) | 74.4511 | 65.4532 | +0.87% | +0.64% |
| σ=0.05 | Kendall #1906 (val=71.43/test=62.99) | 71.6812 | 63.1105 | +0.35% | +0.19% |

W&B runs: `qt63dt0c` (σ=0.01), `k2jgdi56` (σ=0.05). Both confirmed against student-reported numbers.

### Decision: CLOSE

- **Same regression direction at same approximate magnitude despite stack and σ both changing.** Two-arm × two-baseline → strongest possible single-PR signal for flat-or-mild-harm axis.
- Predicted geometry-axis gain on `val_geom_camber_rc` **did not materialize** at either σ (90.31 ≈ 90.32 on pre-Kendall; the 88.68 on Kendall came from Kendall itself, not pos-jitter).
- Diagnostic instrumentation (pre/post-jitter coord std, max_drift=0 on surface) confirmed implementation was bit-correct — the lever just doesn't move.

### Mechanism conclusion

Position-jitter at volume mesh is **flat-or-mild-harm on this stack, independent of loss-weighting baseline**. The model's robustness to small volume-coord perturbations is already saturated by existing inductive biases (PhysicsAttention slot-routing, FiLM-modulated globals, surface-volume mask separation).

### Axis closure status

- **Closes:** input-augmentation via volume-coord noise jitter (σ ∈ {0.01, 0.05} both tested).
- **Does NOT close:** structural geometric augmentations (e.g. SDF-as-feature #1873, still WIP) — different mechanism.
- **Does NOT close:** OOD-attack axes generally — OOD remains the dominant bottleneck.

### Reassignment to PR #2021 (OneCycleLR with warmup on Kendall) — schedule-side axis

Pivoting edward to **fresh schedule-side lever** — OneCycleLR sweep on Kendall baseline.

**Advisor process note:** initially assigned #2016 (DropPath sweep), but a closure-registry audit caught PR #1680 (fern, 2026-05-13 00:11) already tested `drop_path_rate=0.1` on pre-FiLM baseline with the val curve still descending at epoch 14 — the 15-epoch budget cannot absorb stochastic-depth-style regularization. **Withdrew #2016 before student started** and pivoted to OneCycleLR, which doesn't have the under-convergence pathology (same 15 epochs, just reshaped LR profile).

**Why OneCycleLR specifically:** schedule is the ONE mechanism family untouched on this stack (current `CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=15)`). Mechanism-orthogonal to all 7 in-flight PRs (none of #1937, #1938, #1954, #1873, #1757, #1734, #1981 touch schedule). Literature priors strong for short-training regimes (Smith super-convergence, fastai 1cycle, Wightman timm).

- **Arm 1: max_lr=5e-4, pct_start=0.1** (current lr + 10% warmup — pure schedule reshape, most-likely-to-land)
- **Arm 2: max_lr=1e-3, pct_start=0.1** (2× lr buffered by warmup — tests if warmup unlocks lr headroom)
- **Decision rule:** best-arm val < 71.43 → MERGE; both regress → axis closes
- **Critical:** SWA scheduler must continue to take over in final 25% — OneCycleLR can't step past `swa_start_epoch`

If arm 1 lands → finer `pct_start` sweep {0.05, 0.15}. If arm 2 lands → may invalidate #1937 max-norm-tighten direction (lr-headroom changes optimizer-stability story). If both regress → schedule axis closes.

## 2026-05-13 07:38 — PR #1734 (thorfinn, asinh α=0.5 on Kendall) CLOSE

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/asinh-pressure-on-filmed` (rebased onto Kendall + max_norm=0.5)
- **Hypothesis:** Asinh value-level compression on pressure target (α=0.5 gentler arm) — rerun on current Kendall baseline.
- **Result (W&B `o9azpm27`):**

| Metric | This run (SWA) | Kendall baseline #1906 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p | **79.1227** | 71.4346 | **+10.76%** |
| test_avg/mae_surf_p | **70.4069** | 62.9866 | **+11.78%** |

All 4 val splits + 4 test splits regress 7–18%. **Largest regression on the Kendall stack to date.** Decision rule (`val ≥ 75.0 → CLOSE`) fires cleanly.

### Mechanism finding — output-side warps clash with Kendall σ adaptation

The high-info content is the Kendall × asinh interaction trajectory:
- **Kendall self-adapts σ to the asinh-transformed loss space.** Final `log_σ_surf_p = −1.500` (effective weight 10.04) vs Kendall-baseline `log_σ_surf_p = −1.408` (effective weight 8.36).
- **Kendall pushes the pressure-channel weight ~20% higher** to compensate for asinh's compressed loss magnitude.
- This amplification compounds with asinh's per-sample gradient reshape and **overshoots**. Each lever individually was ~flat on FiLM baseline; stacked under Kendall the compounding becomes +10–12% regression.

### Axis closure status

- **Closes:** value-level compression on outputs when stacked on Kendall (asinh α ∈ {0.5, 1.0} both regress under Kendall).
- **General lesson:** future output-side loss-space-reshape hypotheses should consider Kendall σ-adaptation interaction.
- **Asinh on inputs** (different mechanism, not outputs) remains untested.

### Reassignment to PR #2049 (auxiliary log_re prediction head on Kendall)

Pivoting thorfinn to **OOD-targeted representation-bottleneck mechanism** — auxiliary log_re prediction MLP head per block, sweep {0.01, 0.1} weight.

**Rationale:** `test_re_rand` was the OOD split with the LEAST improvement under Kendall (test_re_rand +0.33, basically flat). Forcing intermediate blocks to maintain explicit Re information via aux MSE loss should target this gap directly. Mechanism-orthogonal to all 7 in-flight + Kendall:
- Not optimizer-stability (#1937), not loss-shape (#1757), not value-compression (closed #1734), not loss-weighting (Kendall in baseline; #1981 wd), not arch-structural (#1938), not sample-rebalancing (#1954), not input-aug (#1873), not schedule (#2021).
- **Auxiliary task on intermediate features is a fresh mechanism family.**

- **Arm 1: aux_re_weight=0.01** (gentle, most-likely-to-land)
- **Arm 2: aux_re_weight=0.1** (moderate, tests stronger aux pressure)
- **Decision rule:** best-arm val < 71.43 → MERGE; both regress → axis closes
- **Special override:** `test_re_rand` improvement ≥3% triggers send-back even if val flat — OOD-split target

If 0.01 lands → opens up the aux-task family (geometry-param prediction, flow consistency, etc.). If both regress → Re is implicitly captured by FiLM and aux task is redundant.

## 2026-05-13 08:05 — PR #1954 (askeladd, per-sample HEM via EMA loss tracker) CLOSE

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/hard-example-mining-on-kendall`
- **Hypothesis:** Per-sample focal weighting via EMA-loss-difficulty z-score on Kendall baseline (focal_alpha=0.5, ema_decay=0.9, warmup=3) — sample-level rebalancing targeting OOD splits.
- **Result (W&B `ik5ljgcm`):**

| Metric | This run (SWA) | Kendall baseline #1906 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p | **75.7951** | 71.4346 | **+6.10%** |
| test_avg/mae_surf_p | **67.1214** | 62.9866 | **+6.56%** |

All 4 val + 4 test splits regress 5-8%. Largest hit on test_geom_camber_cruise (+8.48% relative).

### Decision: CLOSE

- Val gap +4.36 is ~5σ above baseline variance band (σ≈0.86) — clean negative, not noise-miss.
- Decision rule (`val ≥ 75.0`) fires cleanly.
- Mechanism engaged correctly (weights hit clamp at both ends from epoch 4) — implementation was bit-correct.

### Mechanism finding — sample-loss-difficulty ≠ OOD-distance

**High-info finding from per-split breakdown:** if HEM were rebalancing toward OOD samples, in-dist split would hurt and OOD splits would help. The data shows the opposite — `val_single_in_dist` (+7.94%) and `test_single_in_dist` (+6.78%) are the LARGEST regressions, not OOD splits.

This means **"hard" by current-loss-magnitude is NOT the same as "OOD-distance hard"** on TandemFoilSet. The EMA-loss tracker upweights samples the current parameters can't fit (likely intrinsically harder fluid-dynamics configurations), causing the model to overfit to those configurations and undergeneralize across the board.

### Axis closure status

- **Closes:** per-sample loss-magnitude-driven rebalancing on Kendall (joins #1691 surf_weight=5 in the loss-reweighting closure family).
- **Confirms:** Kendall's per-channel-σ weighting was the *correct* loss-reweighting lever; per-sample rebalancing beyond Kendall over-shoots.
- **Remains open:** sample-rebalancing where the signal is OOD-distance-aware (validation-split-aware, curriculum on Re, etc.) — different mechanism, not closed by this PR.

### Logging-bug finding (informative)

Student caught that the `hem_loss_spread` diagnostic ratio swings to large negative numbers because Kendall NLL `(0.5 * precision * L_c + log_σ_c).sum(dim=1)` includes a per-sample-constant `log_σ_c` offset that crosses zero. This is a **logging bug, not a correctness bug** — the per-sample z-scores driving the focal weighting were correctly computed. Good diagnostic catch.

### Reassignment to PR #2063 (Lion optimizer sweep on Kendall) — fresh optimizer-family axis

Pivoting askeladd to **fresh optimizer-family lever** — Lion optimizer (Chen et al. 2023). Every win on this stack has been on AdamW; every in-flight regularization PR (#1981 wd, #1937 max-norm, #2021 OneCycleLR) is AdamW-based. **Optimizer choice is the one mechanism family completely untouched.**

**Lion mechanism:**
- Sign-of-EMA-gradient update (vs AdamW's adaptive second-moment scaling)
- Bounded update magnitude intrinsically — current AdamW + grad-clip max_norm=0.5 clips 97% of steps, suggesting AdamW is fighting grad-clip; Lion's binary update bound may resolve this
- Tends toward flatter minima (Chen et al. follow-up papers) → better OOD generalization (classical Hochreiter-Schmidhuber 1997)
- Inline implementation (~30 lines, no `lion-pytorch` dependency)

- **Arm 1: lr=1e-4, wd=1e-3** (Lion-canonical: 5× smaller lr, 10× larger wd than current AdamW) — most-likely-to-land
- **Arm 2: lr=3e-4, wd=3e-4** (intermediate: 1.7× smaller lr, 3× larger wd) — tests Lion's tolerance for higher lr
- **Decision rule:** best-arm val < 71.43 → MERGE; both regress → close optimizer-family axis

If Lion lands → opens up grad-clip-off ablation (Lion's intrinsic bound may make max_norm=0.5 redundant). If both regress → AdamW is optimal on this stack.

## 2026-05-13 08:25 — PR #1937 CLOSE willowpai2g48h2-alphonse (max-norm-tighten {0.25, 0.1} on grad-clip+FiLM): clean negative + clip_fraction-saturation finding

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-alphonse/max-norm-tight-sweep-on-clipfilm`
- **Hypothesis:** Further-tighten grad-clip from max_norm=0.5 to {0.25, 0.1} on pre-Kendall grad-clip+FiLM baseline (val=73.81, test=65.04). Predicted small additional win via cleaner step magnitudes for SWA averaging.
- **Result (W&B `h12tbuku`, `v3m30b74`):**

| Arm | W&B | val_avg | Δ vs 73.81 | test_avg | Δ vs 65.04 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| max_norm=0.25 | h12tbuku | 74.7603 | **+1.29%** | 65.9491 | **+1.40%** |
| max_norm=0.1  | v3m30b74 | **74.0664** | +0.35% | **65.6287** | +0.91% |

Both arms regress vs the pre-Kendall baseline they were assigned against AND vs the merged Kendall baseline (val=71.43, test=62.99). Decision rule fires cleanly.

### Decision: CLOSE

- Best new arm (0.1) val=74.07 > pre-Kendall baseline 73.81 → "all arms regress" branch.
- Non-monotonic ordering (0.1 < 0.25 on val) within ~1σ of 2-seed variance (0.86) — treating as noise.

### High-info finding — clip_fraction saturation

Student's diagnostic table is the key data:

| Arm | grad_norm_mean (pre-clip) | clip_fraction_mean |
|---|---:|---:|
| baseline (0.5) | 4.999 | **99.2%** |
| 0.25 | 5.0315 | **100%** |
| 0.1 | 5.1916 | **100%** |

**Past max_norm=0.5, the clip threshold is no longer a discriminative regularization knob — it's a uniform step-magnitude rescaler.** At 99.2% clip-fraction at 0.5, every step is already being clipped; tighter thresholds rescale every step by the same factor (pre-clip ~5/threshold), behaving as a per-batch lr-cut on the clipped fraction. Combined with cosine-anneal LR shrinkage, this produces uniform underfitting (both arms make per-epoch progress but converge to worse asymptotes).

### Axis closure status

- **Closes:** grad-clip-tightening direction on this stack. Optimizer-stability lever family is exhausted on the tighten direction (clip_fraction=99.2% at 0.5 is a saturation signal — no headroom).
- **Remains open:** adaptive grad-clip (per-epoch percentile threshold) — mechanism-orthogonal continuation; not assigned today as the optimizer-family axis is being explored via #2063 Lion.
- **Stack-relevance note:** student's runs were on pre-Kendall stack (config audit confirmed `use_kendall_uncertainty` absent from W&B configs — matches assignment-time baseline). Closure justified on either stack.

### Reassignment to PR #2082 (Fourier coordinate features {sigma=1.0, 4.0} on Kendall) — fresh input-encoding axis

Pivoting alphonse to **Random Fourier Features** (Tancik et al. 2020 "Fourier Features Let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains", NeurIPS 2020). Input-encoding mechanism family is **untouched on this stack** — distinct from the closed `unified_pos` grid-based encoding axis (#1454/#1551), which was *positional injection* (redundant with normalized coords). RFF is a *representation prior* (sin/cos basis biases the network toward learning high-frequency functions on low-dim coord inputs).

**Mechanism:**
- Random matrix `B ∈ R^(2 × 16)` with `B_ij ~ N(0, σ²)`, frozen at init (registered buffer)
- Encoding: `γ(x) = [sin(2π·B·x), cos(2π·B·x)] ∈ R^32` concatenated with existing input features
- σ controls frequency bandwidth — Tancik et al. found σ has a Goldilocks zone

**Why this axis now:**
- Mechanism-orthogonal to all 8 in-flight + closed PRs (optimizer, schedule, arch, sample-rebal, aux-task, loss-shape, parameter-norm, geometry)
- Strong theoretical backing — ReLU/GELU networks have low-freq bias on low-dim coords; pressure/velocity fields have inherent high-freq components near foil edges
- Low complexity (~30 lines)
- Directly targets `val_geom_camber_rc` (88.09 — highest-error camber split with sharp leading-edge gradients)

**Arms:**
- Arm 1: num_features=16, σ=1.0 (low-freq, conservative) — most-likely-to-land
- Arm 2: num_features=16, σ=4.0 (moderate-freq) — higher-variance, brackets the optimum

**Decision rule:** best-arm val < 71.43 → MERGE; all val > 72.5 → close (Transolver attention already captures high-freq adequately). Special-test override: val_geom_camber_rc improvement ≥4% even if val_avg doesn't beat baseline → 2nd seed.

If σ=1.0 lands → opens compounding with next merged winner. If σ=4.0 lands → revisits the positional-encoding axis with the realization that RFF (representation) was a different mechanism from unified_pos (positional injection).

## 2026-05-13 09:10 — PR #1873 SEND-BACK willowpai2g48h2-fern (SDF on grad-clip+FiLM): rebase + rerun on Kendall stack — strong test win on pre-Kendall baseline, need to confirm compounding

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/sdf-feature-on-clipfilm` (conflicting with current Kendall stack — needs rebase)
- **Hypothesis (original):** Per-node SDF (log1p+standardize) as input feature on grad-clip+FiLM baseline (pre-Kendall #1731, val=74.62 test=66.14).
- **Result on pre-Kendall stack (W&B `s1m3svr8`):**

| Metric | SDF (#1873) | Pre-Kendall baseline #1731 | Δ | vs current Kendall #1906 (71.43/62.99) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) | **74.89** | 74.62 | +0.36% (within 2σ) | **+4.85% regress** |
| test_avg/mae_surf_p (SWA) | **65.10** | 66.14 | **−1.56%** ✓ test win | **+3.35% regress** |

| test_geom_camber_rc | **79.47** | 81.37 | **−2.33%** ✓ | — |

**Mechanism confirmed on pre-Kendall stack:** geometry-aware features deliver predicted asymmetric test gain on geometry-related splits (camber_rc, single_in_dist). Val gain on bottleneck is small (-0.77%) but in the right direction, washed out by `val_geom_camber_cruise` +5.28% (likely SWA-window-clip artifact — student got 2 SWA epochs vs baseline's 3 due to 30-min cap on 15-epoch budget).

### Banked findings (independent of merge decision)

1. **Precomputed SDF is the right wall-clock optimization.** Per-batch `torch.cdist([N, N_surf])` costs ~6 min/epoch on this dataset (NOT the predicted +1-3 min). Student precomputed once at startup (~50 s for all 2000 samples), shipped SDF as 25th channel of `x` — mathematically equivalent to per-batch (verified: `sdf_at_surface_max ≈ 0.0014`). Without precompute, runs hit 30-min cap at epoch 12 with only 1 SWA epoch.
2. **SDF feature is well-scaled.** log1p+standardize compresses heavy-tail max-13m raw distance into [−0.47, 4.83] range. sdf_norm mean ≈ 0. No degenerate behavior.
3. **FiLM continues to learn alongside SDF.** γ_l2=17.23, β_l2=12.37 — unchanged magnitudes from baseline. Geometry-aware features don't kill the FiLM signal.
4. **Per-split val vs test asymmetry:** val_geom_camber_cruise regressed +5.28% but test_geom_camber_cruise only +1.74% — suggests SWA-window shortening hits val more than test (smaller val sample counts 100 vs test's 200).

### Decision: SEND BACK for rebase + rerun on Kendall

Cannot merge against current baseline (val=74.89 > 71.43; test=65.10 > 62.99 → test-override doesn't fire either). Result is on the wrong stack — geometry-aware × Kendall multi-task-weighting are mechanism-orthogonal axes; need to test if they compound.

**Reproduce command for rerun:**
```bash
cd target/ && python train.py \
  --epochs 15 \
  --max_norm 0.5 \
  --use_kendall_uncertainty \
  --use_sdf \
  --seed 0 \
  --agent willowpai2g48h2-fern \
  --wandb_name willowpai2g48h2-fern/sdf-feature-on-kendall \
  --wandb_group sdf-feature-on-kendall
```

Note: changed `--max_norm 1.0` → `0.5` to align with current baseline (which uses #1831's tightened max_norm=0.5).

### Expected outcomes (Bayesian)

- **~50% likelihood: SDF + Kendall compound** (orthogonal axes, both target test_single_in_dist heavily). Predicted val 70.0-71.4 lands.
- **~30%: partial overlap with Kendall.** Diminishing returns since Kendall already exploited in-dist headroom (-8.10 on test_single_in_dist). Predicted val 71.2-72.5.
- **~20%: SDF doesn't stack on Kendall.** Axis closes on this stack. Predicted val 72.5+.

If lands → opens composition with #2049 aux-Re prediction (geometry × Re-conditioning axes), learned-SDF embedding (SDF → MLP[1→4]), and surface arc-length encoding.

### Analysis

**σ=1.0 wins cleanly; σ=4.0 regresses uniformly.** The primary mechanism is selective improvement on `geom_camber_rc` — the persistent FiLM geometry bottleneck — with −4.57% val / −5.26% test. This is the strongest single-split improvement at this bottleneck since FiLM merged.

**Mechanism:** At z-score-normalized coordinate scale (range ≈ [−7, +7], std ≈ 0.82), σ=1.0 nominal behaves like σ≈5 at unit-cube scale — low-frequency encoding that distinguishes global geometry patterns. σ=4.0 (≈σ≈20 effective) is too high-frequency and overfits.

**Bradwidth finding:** monotonic lower-frequency wins. Follow-up should bracket σ=0.5 (thorfinn #2168) and test σ=2.0 to confirm the σ→gain curve shape.

**Kendall stability confirmed:** log_σ values within ±0.02 of baseline — no collapse under +32 input channels.

**Timeout caveat:** both arms hit 30-min cap at epoch 13/15 — SWA averaged over 2 epochs only. Win is likely conservative.

### Decision: MERGED as new baseline (val=70.6271/test=62.0907)

## 2026-05-13 11:50 — PR #2049 CLOSE willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn (aux-Re prediction on Kendall): clean negative — FiLM already preserves Re

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-thorfinn/aux-re-prediction-on-kendall`
- **W&B runs:** `nrrd541j` (arm 1, 0.01), `oxczx0yj` (arm 2, 0.1)

### Results

| Arm | aux_re_weight | swa_val | swa_test | test_re_rand | Δ val |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.0 | 71.43 | 62.99 | 61.92 | — |
| **Arm 1** | 0.01 | **73.93** | **64.74** | **63.35** | **+3.5%** |
| **Arm 2** | 0.1 | **80.96** | **70.99** | **69.29** | **+13.4%** |

Both arms regress. test_re_rand moves in the WRONG direction (+2.3%, +11.9%) — the special OOD override doesn't fire.

### Analysis

**High-info finding: FiLM already preserves Re information across all 5 blocks.** Aux-Re diagnostic shows per-block r≈0.94–0.97 by epoch 2, flat across depth — the model knows Re at every layer. The forced-bottleneck regularizer is solving a nonexistent problem; its gradients compete with the main task's per-token regression. Dose-response is monotonically unfavorable (0.01→0.1 makes things 4× worse).

**Key implication for future work:** The test_re_rand OOD gap is NOT from Re info loss. It comes from Re-conditional feature *interactions* (geometry×Re crosses, attention slicing under shifted Re distribution). Future test_re_rand attacks should target these interactions, not Re scalar preservation.

### Decision: CLOSED — axis closes cleanly

## 2026-05-13 11:52 — PR #1981 CLOSE willowpai2g48h2-nezuko (wd-sweep on Kendall): within noise + new baseline moved past it

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/wd-sweep-on-kendall`
- **W&B runs:** `tslq8om2` (wd=3e-4), `qky28hu9` (wd=1e-3)

### Results

| Arm | wd | swa_val | swa_test | Δ val (vs Kendall #1906) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 1e-4 | 71.435 | 62.987 | — |
| **Arm 1** | 3e-4 | **71.352** | **62.902** | **−0.08 (within noise)** |
| **Arm 2** | 1e-3 | 71.509 | 63.033 | +0.07 |

After merging #2082 RFF, new baseline is val=70.63 — wd=3e-4 result of 71.35 is now a clear regression (+1.04%).

### Analysis

**wd is not biting at this run length.** Student's L2-norm diagnostics confirmed: total model L2 norm differs by only 0.043 (0.09%) between wd=3e-4 and wd=1e-3 over 13 epochs. Gradient updates dominate wd-driven shrinkage at lr=5e-4 and 13-epoch budget. SWA averaging further blurs the difference.

**Kendall σ decoupled:** log_sigma values essentially identical between arms (designed behavior — log_sigma has weight_decay=0 in optimizer).

### Decision: CLOSED — wd axis closes (not a lever at this scale/lr/budget)

## 2026-05-13 11:55 — PR #1757 SEND-BACK willowpai2g48h2-frieren (β=0.3 on RFF+Kendall): pre-Kendall run, needs rerun on full current stack

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-frieren/beta-0p3-on-filmed`
- **Result on grad-clip+FiLM stack (max_norm=1.0, NO Kendall, NO RFF):** swa_val=72.11, swa_test=62.91

vs current baseline (PR #2082, val=70.63/test=62.09): val **+2.12% regress**, test **+1.32% regress**.

### Context

Student ran on the pre-Kendall stack (#1731 grad-clip+FiLM, max_norm=1.0). Since then, #1906 (Kendall) and #2082 (RFF) have both merged. Sent back with new reproduce command for the full stack:

```bash
cd target/ && python train.py \
  --epochs 15 --max_norm 0.5 --use_kendall_uncertainty \
  --fourier_features --fourier_num_features 16 --fourier_sigma 1.0 \

  --wandb_name willowpai2g48h2-frieren/beta-0p3-on-rff-kendall \
  --wandb_group beta-on-rff-kendall
```

The β=0.3 mechanism (monotonic improvement, test asymmetry, camber_rc / test_re_rand gain) is confirmed on older stacks. The question is whether it continues to compound on the current RFF+Kendall stack, which is more orthogonal. Alphonse's #2171 concurrently tests β=0.1 on the same stack.

### Decision: SENT BACK for rerun on Kendall+RFF stack

## 2026-05-13 12:15 — PR #2063 SEND-BACK willowpai2g48h2-askeladd (Lion optimizer on Kendall): MASSIVE win verified, rebase + rerun on RFF+Kendall stack required

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/lion-optimizer-on-kendall`
- **Result (Kendall-only stack, no RFF):** Arm 2 (lr=3e-4, wd=3e-4) SWA val=**50.1862**, SWA test=**42.6893**
- **W&B independent verification:** confirmed `tuj3eknw` (arm 1: val=60.12, test=51.06), `c65qyw5x` (arm 2: val=50.19, test=42.69) — metrics match student claim exactly
- vs Kendall baseline #1906 (71.43/62.99): arm 2 = **−29.74% val / −32.23% test**
- vs RFF baseline #2082 (70.63/62.09): arm 2 = **−28.93% val / −31.25% test**

### This is the biggest single-PR gain on this branch by ~10× (largest prior was Kendall's −3.22%)

### Per-split SWA (arm 2)

| Split | val (Lion) | test (Lion) | val (Kendall) | test (Kendall) | Δ val | Δ test |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 54.13 | 43.77 | 79.18 | 68.64 | −31.6% | −36.2% |
| geom_camber_rc | 64.89 | 58.30 | 88.09 | 79.95 | −26.3% | −27.1% |
| geom_camber_cruise | 31.15 | 25.94 | 49.19 | 41.44 | −36.7% | −37.4% |
| re_rand | 50.57 | 42.74 | 69.29 | 61.92 | −27.0% | −31.0% |

All 4 splits improve >25%. No regression. Mechanism is real, broad, and uniform.

### Mechanism (banked, three findings)

1. **Lion's sign-update verified:** `optimizer_update_norm = √n_params = 863.91` at every single step. Lion is applying unit-magnitude sign updates as designed. The scale knob is purely lr.
2. **Grad-clip fires less under Lion:** 70-81% of steps clipped (vs AdamW's 97%). Lion's intrinsic bounded-update makes grad-clip partially redundant. Mean grad-norm is comparable (~1.1), but Lion's gradient distribution has a lower right tail.
3. **Lion COLLAPSES Kendall σ heads to uniform.** All 6 log_sigma channels evolve in lockstep (identical step-by-step values across 4875 train steps). Mechanism: sign(EMA) update strips magnitude, all 6 channels share the same sign sequence → identical ±lr update → identical final values. **Lion + Kendall is mechanistically equivalent to Lion + uniform-channel-weighting.**

### Cannot merge as-is (two issues)

1. **Merge conflict:** Branch is dirty against current advisor (RFF #2082 merged after assignment). Mergeable_state = "dirty".
2. **Untested composition:** Lion run lacked RFF. We need to confirm Lion + RFF + Kendall compose before merging (Lion alone is already a 30% win; the question is whether RFF adds further or interferes).

### Decision: SEND BACK for rebase + rerun arm 2 only on RFF+Kendall stack

```bash
cd target/ && python train.py \
  --epochs 15 --max_norm 0.5 --use_kendall_uncertainty \
  --fourier_features --fourier_num_features 16 --fourier_sigma 1.0 \
  --optimizer lion --lr 3e-4 --weight_decay 3e-4 \
  --seed 0 \
  --agent willowpai2g48h2-askeladd \
  --wandb_name willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/lion-lr3e-4-wd3e-4-on-rff-kendall \
  --wandb_group lion-on-rff-kendall
```

**Prediction:** Lion + RFF will land val ∈ [48, 60]. Lion is dominant; RFF may add 1-3% on top or be largely subsumed. If val < 70.63, merge. If val < 60, that's a clean massive win.

**Skip arm 1** (lr=1e-4) — dominated by arm 2.

## 2026-05-13 12:45 — PR #2021 SEND-BACK willowpai2g48h2-edward (OneCycleLR max_lr=1e-3 on Kendall): BIG WIN verified, rebase + rerun on RFF+Kendall stack required

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/onecycle-lr-on-kendall`
- **Result (Kendall-only stack, no RFF):** Arm 2 (max_lr=1e-3, pct_start=0.1) SWA val=**67.1895**, SWA test=**59.0139**
- vs Kendall baseline #1906 (71.43/62.99): **−5.94% val / −6.31% test**
- vs RFF baseline #2082 (70.63/62.09): **−4.87% val / −4.97% test** (wins even without RFF!)
- W&B runs: `ce4cko32` (arm 1: val=69.81, test=61.72), `cw0dxu3k` (arm 2: val=67.19, test=59.01)

### Per-split SWA arm 2 (max_lr=1e-3)

| Split | val | test | Δ val vs Kendall | Δ test vs Kendall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 77.993 | 68.544 | −1.18 | −0.09 |
| geom_camber_rc | 80.528 | 73.523 | **−7.56** | **−6.43** |
| geom_camber_cruise | 45.012 | 37.470 | **−4.18** | **−3.97** |
| re_rand | 65.225 | 56.519 | **−4.06** | **−5.40** |

Every OOD split improves. Biggest gain: geom_camber_rc (the persistent FiLM bottleneck).

### Mechanism (banked)

1. **Super-convergence as Smith 2018 predicts** — 2× peak lr + warmup finds a wider, flatter optimum
2. **Kendall σ heads sharpen dramatically** in arm 2 vs baseline: surf_Ux log_σ −2.402 vs baseline −1.500 (σ halved from 0.22 → 0.09). All 6 channels. The model reached a flatter optimum where it can confidently weight all channels more aggressively.
3. **Warmup did NOT destabilize σ** — contra pre-registered risk; warmup gave σ heads a clean settling period
4. **Arm 1 (max_lr=5e-4 + warmup):** val=69.81, test=61.72 — warmup alone helps (−2.27% val); combined lr-bump is the real lever

### Cannot merge as-is

Branch lacks RFF (dirty conflict with current advisor). Sent back for arm 2 rerun on full RFF+Kendall stack with same OneCycleLR config.

**Rerun command:**
```bash
cd target/ && python train.py \
  --epochs 15 --max_norm 0.5 --use_kendall_uncertainty \
  --fourier_features --fourier_num_features 16 --fourier_sigma 1.0 \

  --wandb_name willowpai2g48h2-edward/onecycle-maxlr-1e-3-on-rff-kendall \
  --wandb_group onecycle-on-rff-kendall
```

Prediction: OneCycle + RFF compose constructively → val ∈ [62, 67].

## 2026-05-13 12:45 — PR #1938 CLOSED willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro (per-token FiLM on max_norm=0.5 baseline): CLEAN REGRESSION — 4th FiLM-head modification to regress

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-tanjiro/film-per-token`
- **Result:** SWA val=**77.91** (+5.55% vs #1831 baseline 73.81), test=**68.77** (+5.73%)
- vs current RFF+Kendall baseline #2082 (70.63): val regression of +10.3%
- W&B run: `yeyreqgs`

### Per-split (vs #1831 baseline)

All splits regress. OOD splits worst: geom_camber_cruise val +10.78%, re_rand test +9.55%.

### Mechanism (banked — important)

- γ_surf/γ_vol cosine similarity = 0.44 (< 0.5 threshold) — structural mechanism ENGAGED; heads do learn distinct directions
- Yet model gets worse → **shared-γ constraint IS the right inductive bias** on 1499-sample dataset
- Removing shared constraint lets heads overfit per-sample noise (classic OOD-hit signature)
- γ_vol grows ~26% larger than γ_surf — same volume-token-count effect seen in #1760 and #1838

### Closed axes: FiLM head modifications (4 total, all regress)

1. #1760 width-double → regressed
2. #1838 depth-bump → regressed
3. #1909 tanh-bound → regressed
4. #1938 per-token (this PR) → regressed

**Next FiLM lever must operate OUTSIDE the head architecture.** The FiLM head itself is well-tuned; the next opportunity is: what the head SEES (input conditioning), what it FEEDS INTO (surface-only gating), or how it COMPOSES (deeper stack at different abstraction levels with different conditioners).

- W&B run: (per student's PR comment)

### Per-split regression (vs RFF baseline)

| Split | RFF baseline | #1873 (SDF) | Δ val | Δ test |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| single_in_dist | 78.74 / 69.24 | 84.16 / 73.61 | +6.88% | +6.32% |
| geom_camber_rc | 84.06 / 75.74 | 88.45 / 80.21 | +5.22% | +5.91% |
| geom_camber_cruise | 50.11 / 41.42 | 52.91 / 43.79 | +5.59% | +5.72% |
| re_rand | 69.59 / 61.96 | 74.16 / 65.16 | +6.57% | +5.17% |
| **avg** | **70.63 / 62.09** | **74.92 / 65.69** | **+6.08%** | **+5.79%** |

ALL four splits regress uniformly. Even the original target bottleneck (geom_camber_rc) gets worse. Student concurs CLOSE.

### Mechanism findings (banked — important)

1. **SDF and Kendall compete (not compound) on `test_single_in_dist` headroom.** Pre-Kendall SDF baseline had val=74.89; Kendall+SDF has val=74.92 — Kendall is essentially a no-op when stacked on top of SDF. Both mechanisms appear to draw on the same in-distribution improvement budget.

2. **Kendall σ-head is robust to input-channel additions.** Adding +1 SDF channel produced σ drift ≤0.006 vs Kendall-only. σ-adaptation conditions on output statistics, not input dimensionality. (Useful for evaluating future input-encoding experiments.)

3. **Geometry-as-raw-input axis closes on the RFF+Kendall stack.** Sign that geometry features need to be injected through learned representations (coordinate encoding via RFF, attention biases) rather than concatenated as raw scalars. RFF itself is the working mechanism for adding geometric structure.

### Closed axes: geometry-as-raw-input attempts (this is the 2nd close in the family)

- Curvature features were considered (researcher-agent idea #3) — same family as SDF, deferred indefinitely.
- Next geometry attack must be **through attention or coordinate encoding**, not channel concat.

## 2026-05-13 13:35 — PR #2215 WITHDRAWN willowpai2g48h2-fern (DropPath on RFF+Kendall): closed before student start, prior closure registry hit

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/droppath-on-rff-kendall`
- **Why withdrawn:** Audit revealed PR #1680 already tested `drop_path_rate=0.1` uniform on the same 5-layer architecture (fern, closed 2026-05-13). Result: val=109.52 / test=99.35 = +14.4% / +15.3% regression. **Mechanism finding from #1680 closure: at 5 layers, dropping any block removes 20% of the effective forward path — layer-count-dependent under-convergence pathology, not strength-dependent.** PR #2016 (askeladd-edward) was withdrawn 2026-05-13 07:07 for the same reason. My linear-0.1 setting (avg 5%) was what #2016 had flagged as "too gentle to matter on 5 blocks" — even if it converged, the literature-prior gain is correspondingly weaker.
- **Process lesson:** must search closure registry before assigning. Tracked.

## 2026-05-13 13:50 — PR #2220 ASSIGNED willowpai2g48h2-fern (LayerScale CaiT-style on RFF+Kendall): residual-rescaling regularization (replaces #2215)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-fern/layerscale-on-rff-kendall`
- **Hypothesis:** LayerScale (Touvron et al. ICCV 2021 "Going Deeper with Image Transformers / CaiT") — replace each residual addition `x + branch(x)` with `x + γ ⊙ branch(x)` where γ is a learnable per-channel parameter initialized at 1e-4. **Mechanism-distinct from DropPath:** scales residuals continuously rather than dropping them stochastically — no under-convergence risk.
- **Mechanism axis:** Architecture-level residual rescaling (orthogonal to all 7 in-flight PRs). Effectively a soft depth-annealer: t=0 residuals nearly inactive, growing where signal is useful.
- **Why this clears #1680's closure:** DropPath was closed for *removing forward-path fraction* on a 5-layer net. LayerScale never removes the forward path — γ is continuous and gradient-driven. Plus LayerScale has been the de-facto regularizer in modern ViTs (CaiT, ConvNeXt, BEiT) since 2021.
- **Prediction:** val < 70.63 by 0.5–1.5%, biggest gain on `val_geom_camber_rc` (84.06 still our largest bottleneck) — γ should amplify FiLM-conditioned channels that RFF helped on camber.
- **Run:** single-arm, layerscale_init=1e-4, all other config identical to PR #2082 reproduce command.

### Banked: known-tried regularization axes (do not re-launch)

- ✗ DropPath uniform 0.1 (#1680) — under-convergence at 5 layers
- ✗ DropPath sweep {0.1, 0.2} linear (#2016 withdrawn) — same mechanism concern
- ✗ Attention dropout 0.1 (#1733) — closed

- ✗ Re-jitter σ=0.05 (#1787) — closed
- ✗ AdamW weight decay sweep {3e-4, 1e-3} (#1981) — wd not biting

### Open regularization axes after #2220 launches

- LayerScale (CaiT, this PR #2220) — residual rescaling
- Mixup / sample interpolation — never tried, could close OOD gap
- Surface-normal aux head — never tried, geometry signal without input concat
- Re-conditional attention bias — directly addresses #2049 finding (test_re_rand from Re-conditional interactions, not Re-info loss)

- **W&B run:** `sowno0vg` (verified independently — all numbers match to 4dp)
- **Result:** SWA val=**66.6617** / test=**58.3234** — **−5.62% / −6.06% vs prior baseline (70.63/62.09)**

### Per-split SWA (surface MAE, p)

| **avg** | **66.662** | **−5.62%** | **58.323** | **−6.06%** |

All 4 splits win on both val and test. Largest test gain `re_rand` (−7.70%) — 3rd reproduction of β↓ × OOD-Re mechanism.

### Analysis

β=0.3 on β=0.0 stack:
- First run (Kendall-only): val=70.05 / test=61.42 — missed old RFF baseline
- **This run (RFF+Kendall)**: val=66.66 / test=58.32 — clear win on full stack

Key mechanism insight (RFF removes the Kendall-only regression): Kendall-only β=0.3 had `test_single_in_dist` regress +4.15% vs #1906. RFF closes this by providing coordinate geometry signal that disambiguates in-distribution samples without relying on pressure spike gradients. β=0.3 + RFF compound constructively.

- **Earlier result (Kendall-only, no β):** val=67.19/test=59.01 — was a −5.94% win vs old Kendall baseline (70.63), but this was BEFORE β=0.3 merged

### Analysis

Pre-SWA val reached 75.65 at epoch 13 — significant overshoot indicator. SWA recovered to 69.02 but insufficient.

**Mechanism (banked):** β=0.3 flattens the loss landscape (fewer large-gradient spikes from outliers). OneCycle max_lr=1e-3 is calibrated to the β=1.0 curvature — on a smoother β=0.3 loss, the same high lr causes larger parameter oscillations and overshooting. The "super-convergence" benefit of OneCycle depends on the loss curvature enabling fast escape from sharp minima; β=0.3 reduces that curvature.

**Key finding (axis-specific):** OneCycle max_lr=1e-3 won on β=1.0 stack (val=67.19 < 70.63) but LOSES on β=0.3 stack (val=69.02 > 66.66). Schedule-axis experiments on the future stack must re-calibrate lr for the β=0.3 loss landscape.

| 8 | 89.38 | 9.6e-5 | 6.3e-3 |
| 13 | 78.99 | 2.4e-5 | 6.6e-3 |

### Analysis

Same depth-starvation failure mode as #1680 DropPath. At 5 layers, γ_attn never left initialization (mean ~2e-5), γ_mlp grew only ~66× to mean ~6.6e-3 (needs ~0.1-1.0 for useful residual contribution). CaiT's γ_init=1e-4 requires 24+ layers to warm up to useful magnitudes within typical epoch budgets. At 5 layers, the 15-epoch budget is insufficient.

**Critical distinction from DropPath:** DropPath *stochastically drops* blocks (removes 20% of forward path per block at 5 layers). LayerScale *attenuates* residuals by 100× — different mechanism, same starvation outcome. The init regime, not the drop mechanism, was the fatal design choice for shallow networks.

**Key mechanistic finding:** Kendall σ collapsed to near-uniform (σ range 0.222-0.243 = 9% spread) because the under-fit dominates all per-channel signals — same failure mode as Lion+Kendall at insufficient fit quality.

**Student suggested follow-up (assigned next):** ReZero variant with γ_init=1.0 — start at full residual strength, let optimizer prune. Assigned as PR #2269.

### Analysis

**Monotonic β trend does NOT hold past β=0.3.** The prediction "smaller β = better" fails at β=0.1:
- β=1.0 → β=0.3: val 70.63 → 66.66 (−5.62% improvement)
- β=0.3 → β=0.1: val 66.66 → 67.55 (+1.34% regression)

β=0.3 appears to be the optimum on this stack. β=0.2 (edward #2243, in flight) confirms the bracket.

**Key diagnostic (mechanism):** `train/clip_fraction=1.000` throughout entire run. β=0.1 makes the loss near-linear (L1 everywhere), producing uniform-magnitude gradients that exceed max_norm=0.5 on every batch. This hard caps effective step sizes and slows early convergence. Despite this, β=0.1 still beat the OLD β=1.0 baseline — but doesn't beat β=0.3 because the grad-clip binds more under β=0.1 than under β=0.3.

**Interaction banked:** clip_fraction under β=0.3 is also likely high (alphonse confirmed it for β=0.1; the β=0.3 baseline clip_fraction is unverified). max_norm relaxation sweep assigned to alphonse (#2270).

### Analysis

σ=0.5 beats OLD baseline (β=0.0) but loses to NEW baseline (β=0.3, val=66.66). Decision:
- σ direction is real and monotonic: σ=4.0 worst → σ=2.0 regression → σ=1.0 current → σ=0.5 best → σ=0.25 (untested)
- Mechanism: lower σ = smoother/lower-frequency Fourier features = global smoothness prior, benefits irregular CFD mesh
- σ and β=0.3 are orthogonal (input encoding vs loss), likely compose

| **avg** | **70.627** | **72.217** | **+2.25%** |

### Analysis — root cause proven mechanistically by student

Per-epoch base model val during the SWA window (frac=0.6):
- epoch 10 (1st SWA epoch, frac=0.6): val=83.45 — model still rapidly descending
- epoch 11 (2nd SWA epoch): val=81.02
- epoch 12 (1st SWA epoch at frac=0.75): val=73.70 — approaching convergence
- epoch 13 (best base): val=71.30

SWA from frac=0.6 includes 2 very high-error snapshots (epochs 10-11) that drag the average UP. The cosine schedule doesn't reach flat-loss territory until epoch 12-13 with T_max=15 and 30-min timeout.

**Banked mechanism (important):** SWA requires lr to be at <0.3× initial lr. With CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=15) and 30-min timeout cutting at epoch 13, the flat region only begins at epoch ~12 (frac≈0.80). Any SWA frac < 0.75 samples pre-convergence snapshots. This bounds swa_start_frac from below.

**Follow-up assigned:** EMA model weights (#2285 tanjiro) — continuous averaging that doesn't require lr plateau assumption.

### Analysis

Lion's sign-update rule produces bounded per-step updates (optimizer_update_norm = constant √n_params = 868.63 at every step, confirmed throughout the run). Grad-clip fires only 74% of steps under Lion (vs ~97% under AdamW), which means the model sees more full-magnitude gradient information.

**Composition with β=0.3 confirmed:** val improved from 50.97 (Lion on β=0.0 stack) to 47.64 (Lion on β=0.3 stack). The two mechanisms (optimizer rule vs loss shape) are independent and stack additively: β=0.3 contributes its loss-smoothing benefit on top of Lion's update efficiency.

**Kendall σ-collapse remains:** all 6 log_σ channels converge to −0.904 (identical) under Lion, producing uniform per-channel weighting (3.05× scale). Lion+Kendall is mechanically equivalent to Lion+uniform-channel-weight. This is a known property of Lion's sign-update, and does not invalidate the merge — the uniform weighting happens to outperform AdamW's learned weighting in this regime.

**Largest bottleneck shift:** geom_camber_rc (hardest split) improved from val=79.81 to 62.86 (−21.2%). This is the first time geom_camber_rc has been pushed meaningfully below 70. Still the largest remaining gap relative to other splits.

### Analysis

ReZero γ=1.0 avoided depth-starvation collapse (compare to #2220 γ_init=1e-4 which never exceeded 2e-5), but didn't provide useful inductive bias. At 5 layers, standard residual connections already provide adequate gradient flow, so γ near 1.0 is effectively a no-op with extra parameters.

| test_avg/mae_surf_p | 61.65 | +5.7% regression | +52.0% regression |

W&B: tanjiro EMA run (see PR comments).

### Mechanism analysis (banked finding)

EMA decay=0.999 has effective averaging window ~5 epochs (1/(1-decay) = 1000-step EMA at batch level ≈ 5 epochs at 250 batches/epoch). Our 30-min-bound cosine schedule (T_max=15, ~13 actual epochs due to timeout) front-loads its lr drop into epochs 11-13 — lr drops ~4x over those 3 epochs entering eta_min.

EMA's 5-epoch window therefore dilutes those late-epoch low-lr updates with stale higher-lr snapshots from epochs 8-10. Final EMA model sits at average of high-lr and low-lr points instead of the pure low-lr regime SWA achieves with its sharp window cut at swa_start_frac=0.75.

Per-epoch trajectory observed: EMA briefly overtook base val at epoch 11 (76.92 vs 77.47), then base sprinted ahead as cosine entered eta_min plateau (epochs 12-13 base lr drops dominate; EMA can't catch up).

### Why this is not just a decay-tuning problem

- decay=0.9999 would need ~50 epochs window — we have ~15
- decay=0.99 would track too closely to base model — no averaging benefit
- The root mismatch is **schedule shape** (front-loaded eta_min entry), not averaging method

**EMA axis CLOSED at decay=0.999 on this schedule.** Right fix is faster cosine schedule (smaller T_max) so eta_min plateau covers more of the averaging window — handing this to tanjiro next.

This directly informs tanjiro's #2342 T_max work (faster cosine → more flat-region epochs for SWA to average over).

**RFF spectral-dim axis CLOSED at n=16.** RFF mechanism itself (#2082) intact, width sweep exhausted.

## 2026-05-13 14:08 — PR #2347 ASSIGNED willowpai2g48h2-edward (Drop grad-clip on Lion baseline)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-edward/drop-grad-clip-on-lion`
- **Hypothesis:** Lion's sign-update naturally bounds per-step weight changes; external max_norm=0.5 (clip fires 74% under Lion) is over-constraining the sign computation by flipping near-zero coordinates.
- **Two arms:** max_norm ∈ {0.0 (off), 2.0 (relaxed)}
- **No code changes needed** — `--max_norm 0` already disables clipping in existing code (`if cfg.max_norm > 0` gate).
- **Target:** val < 47.64 / test < 40.57. Distinct from alphonse's #2270 (max_norm {0.75,1.0} on β=0.3, AdamW stack).

## 2026-05-13 14:09 — PR #2354 ASSIGNED willowpai2g48h2-nezuko (Lion + n_hidden=192 larger model)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/lion-larger-model-hidden-192`
- **Hypothesis:** Lion scales better with model size than AdamW (Chen 2023). Current 0.76M-param model is undersized — VRAM headroom ~45 GB / 96 GB allows substantial capacity bump.
- **Single arm:** n_hidden 128 → 192 (1.5×) — predicted ~1.5-1.8M params, VRAM ~65-70 GB.
- **Code change:** Add `--n_hidden` CLI flag (default -1 = use 128). Wire into model_config and wandb logging.
- **Target:** val < 47.64. Predict 2-5% improvement if Lion's capacity-scaling hypothesis holds.

## 2026-05-13 14:15 — PR #2240 CLOSED willowpai2g48h2-frieren (Gradient Centralization on β=0.3+RFF+Kendall)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-frieren/gradient-centralization-on-beta0p3`
- **Hypothesis:** GC (Yong 2020) zero-centers gradient rows to reduce variance + improve OOD generalization.
- **Results (terminal, W&B run `t1d1vxsm`):**

| Metric | β=0.3 baseline | GC | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| swa_val_avg/mae_surf_p | 66.66 | 70.12 | +5.18% regression |
| swa_test_avg/mae_surf_p | 58.32 | 61.45 | +5.36% regression |
| base val (best, epoch 13) | 68.05 | 69.79 | +2.56% |

**vs current Lion baseline (47.64/40.57):** +47% / +51% — far outside merge bracket.

### Per-split SWA val (PR decision criteria)
- val_single_in_dist: 74.62 → 80.28 (+5.66) ← largest regression on most in-dist split
- val_geom_camber_rc: 79.81 → 85.04 (+5.23) ← OOD split, also regressed
- val_geom_camber_cruise: 44.65 → 46.75 (+2.10)
- val_re_rand: 67.57 → 68.39 (+0.82)

### Three banked mechanism findings (excellent diagnostic work)

1. **GC hook verified working** — grad row-mean abs 1.5e-3 → 3.3e-10 after hook on 56 weight tensors. Null is genuine.
2. **GC ≠ clip-frequency reducer.** Clip_fraction=100% in BOTH baseline and GC; grad_norm_mean essentially identical (11.36 vs 11.25). GC zero-centers rows but doesn't reduce L2 norm → global-norm clipping unaffected. PR mechanism prediction wrong.
3. **GC disrupts SWA basin geometry.** Baseline SWA improves over best-base by −1.39; GC SWA *degrades* by +0.33. GC's removed gradient DOF prevents late-epoch checkpoints from spreading across the flat basin SWA needs. Strong signal that GC perturbs the geometry SWA relies on.

### Bonus banked finding (cross-experiment)

Frieren independently noted clip_fraction=100% in baseline → corroborates edward's #2347 hypothesis (drop grad-clip on Lion). Two students reaching same diagnostic from different angles.

**GC axis CLOSED at small-data regime.** Yong et al.'s ImageNet-scale gains don't transfer to TandemFoilSet's 1.5K-sample × 0.76M-param overparameterized regime.

## 2026-05-13 14:19 — PR #2363 ASSIGNED willowpai2g48h2-frieren (Lion + linear warmup 3 epochs)

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-frieren/lion-linear-warmup`
- **Hypothesis:** Frieren's #2240 epoch-by-epoch trace showed strong early-epoch oscillation (epoch 1: val=189.70, epoch 6→7 regression at lr≈2.8e-4). Combined with clip_fraction=100% diagnostic, this is the textbook signature for warmup helping. Lion paper (Chen 2023) explicitly recommends longer warmup.
- **Code change:** Add `--warmup_epochs` CLI flag. Use SequentialLR(LinearLR + CosineAnnealingLR). Adjust swa_start_epoch to skip warmup region. Use eta_min=lr*0.05.
- **Single arm:** warmup_epochs=3, cosine T_max=12 over remaining epochs.
- **Target:** val < 47.64. Builds directly on frieren's domain expertise from #2240 diagnostic.
- Independent axis from tanjiro's #2342 (T_max sweep, no warmup) and edward's #2347 (drop grad-clip) — all three target the same lr-schedule region with different mechanisms.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/lion-larger-model-hidden-192`
- **Hypothesis:** Lion's capacity scaling (Chen 2023) should benefit 192-dim model on TandemFoilSet.
- **Results (terminal, W&B run `fgm8dlln`):**

| Metric | Lion baseline (SWA) | n_hidden=192 (BASE-BEST) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| val_avg/mae_surf_p | 47.64 | 53.58 | +12.5% regression |

| step time | ~138s | ~197s | +43% |
| peak VRAM | ~45 GB | ~62 GB | well under cap |

### Procedural failure: SWA never triggered

With swa_start_epoch=11 (0-indexed) but only 11 epochs (0-indexed 0-10) running, **swa_active=0**. SWA AveragedModel was never updated → its eval returned garbage (val=415, test=397). Reported headline is BASE-BEST vs baseline's SWA-best — apples-to-oranges. Mechanism prediction (Lion scales with capacity) remains untested, not falsified.

### Two banked findings

1. **Kendall σ-collapse persists at 1.61M params (2.1× scale).** All 6 channels collapsed to identical −0.8364. **σ-collapse is structural** (sign-update + balanced sampler interaction), NOT capacity-driven. Confirms fern's #2311 hybrid-optimizer is the right fix — width scaling doesn't break the pathology.
2. **Width-scaling capacity bumps are gated by SWA window in 30-min cap.** Any future capacity experiment must use either (a) lower swa_start_frac to fit SWA before timeout, OR (b) compute-frugal capacity dimension (depth or slice_num scale linearly, not quadratically).

**n_hidden width-scaling axis CLOSED at this compute budget.** Cleaner test would need swa_start_frac lowered AND wall-clock relaxed, but per launch rules SENPAI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30 is fixed.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-nezuko/lion-slice-num-96`
- **Hypothesis:** slice_num is Transolver's geometric-token count for Physics-Attention. Increasing 64→96 adds capacity along the geometric inductive-bias axis with linear (not quadratic) compute cost — should fit in 30-min budget where n_hidden=192 didn't.
- **Targets geom_camber_rc bottleneck** (val=62.86 — largest split gap). More physics tokens → richer geometric basis for novel camber profiles.
- **Code change:** Add `--slice_num` CLI flag, wire into model_config.
- **Predicted params:** ~1.07M (vs 0.76M baseline, 1.61M failed n_hidden=192). Slice_num scales linearly.
- **Target:** val < 47.64. Bonus signal: if geom_camber_rc specifically improves >3 points even on close-call avg, banked even if not merged.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/lion-lr-sweep-on-beta0p3`
- **Hypothesis:** Map Lion lr response curve around baseline 3e-4.
- **Results (terminal, 3 arms):**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| baseline | 3e-4 | 47.64 | 40.57 | — | — | `5hp3gid7` |

### Decision: close (not merge arm 2)

Arm 2 has mixed val/test direction (val −0.07, test +0.06) at noise-level. Per CLAUDE.md "insist on the matching test metric" for paper-facing comparisons, this is not decision-grade evidence.

### Three banked findings

1. **V-shape confirmed, lr=3e-4 near optimum.** Cost grows roughly symmetrically in log-lr space. **Lr axis CLOSED.**
2. **Kendall log_σ collapse rate scales tightly with lr** (−0.60 / −1.20 / −1.51 at lr 2e-4/4e-4/5e-4). Higher lr → faster σ-collapse. **Third independent confirmation** that fern's #2311 hybrid Lion+AdamW-for-σ is the right approach.
3. **clip_fraction=1.00 across all 3 lr arms.** **Third independent source** (after frieren #2240 and baseline). Strong evidence max_norm=0.5 is over-constraining — directly validates edward's #2347 drop-grad-clip experiment.

- **Branch:** `willowpai2g48h2-askeladd/lion-wd-sweep-on-beta0p3`
- **Hypothesis:** Current wd=3e-4 inherited from AdamW tuning may be sub-optimal for Lion. Chen 2023 paper notes Lion typically needs 3-10× higher wd than AdamW because sign-update magnitude is bounded.
- **Three-arm bracket:** wd ∈ {1e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3} (under-decay control, 3× current, 10× current).
- **No code changes needed** — `--weight_decay` already a CLI flag.
- **Target:** val < 47.64 AND test ≤ 40.57. Bonus signal: wd=3e-3 may close geom_camber_rc gap via stronger OOD regularization.
- Builds on askeladd's lr-sweep template (#2297 closed, banked V-shape findings).
