# SENPAI Research Results — willow-pai2g-48h-r3

Round 1 of a fresh launch on advisor branch `icml-appendix-willow-pai2g-48h-r3`.
All eight hypotheses (PRs #1504–#1511) dispatched 2026-05-12; results recorded below as they land.

## 2026-05-12 19:30 — PR #1510: Fourier positional encoding (L=6) for (x, z)

- **Student:** willowpai2g48h3-tanjiro
- **Branch:** willowpai2g48h3-tanjiro/fourier-pos-enc
- **Hypothesis:** Add NeRF-style Fourier features (`sin(2^k π x), cos(2^k π x)` for k=0..5, scale=1.0) on the spatial coords prepended to the input. Predicted Δ on `val_avg/mae_surf_p`: −3% to −10%.

### Results

| Split | val mae_surf_p | test mae_surf_p |
|---|---:|---:|
| `single_in_dist` | 138.27 | 121.63 |
| `geom_camber_rc` | 146.15 | 140.23 |
| `geom_camber_cruise` | 93.25 | **NaN** ⚠️ |
| `re_rand` | 107.96 | 108.53 |
| **`avg/mae_surf_p`** | **121.41** | **NaN** (3-split mean = 123.46) |

W&B run: `fp227kem`. Best checkpoint at epoch 13/14 (run hit the 30-min wall-time cap mid-epoch-14). Total params: 0.67M. Peak VRAM: 42.3 GB.

### Conclusion

**Not merged — sent back.** `test_avg/mae_surf_p` is NaN because at least one sample in `test_geom_camber_cruise` produced inf/NaN on the pressure channel during the end-of-run test eval. Per the no-NaN-on-primary-metric rule, this is disqualifying for merge even though val_avg is finite.

The student's diagnosis (Fourier max freq 32π → slice_norm collapse on one outlier sample → pressure-head amplification to inf) is well-reasoned. The cleanest fix is the already-in-PR fallback: re-run with `pos_scale=0.1`, dropping the max frequency to 3.2π ≈ 10. Sent back with that instruction.

### Follow-up

PR #1510 returned to WIP with explicit instructions to retry only the `pos_scale=0.1` variant. Acceptance criterion for the retry: `test_avg/mae_surf_p` must be finite across all four test splits.
